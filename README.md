## üì£ News

‚≠ê Our paper has been **[nominated for the Best Paper Award](https://aied2025.itd.cnr.it/index.php/program/main-track-best-papers-nominees/)** at the  
**26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025).**

We are honored by this recognition and grateful to the community! üôè

## Project Summary

This project uses **DysText**, a novel metric designed to evaluate and quantify the dyslexia-friendliness of text outputs, particularly from language models (LMs). It is built on accessibility principles from the **[British Dyslexia Association‚Äôs Dyslexia Style Guide](https://cdn.bdadyslexia.org.uk/uploads/documents/Advice/style-guide/BDA-Style-Guide-2023.pdf?v=1680514568)** and aims to support research into how well AI systems adhere to these criteria.

The study critically assesses popular LLMs on their ability to:
- Identify dyslexia-relevant stylistic features
- Generate accessible, dyslexia-friendly content

## üî¨ Research Context

- LMs knowledge of dyslexia-friendly criteria in text _(Go to [data/RQ1](https://github.com/eilkou/DysText/tree/main/data/RQ1))_
- A custom metric for measuring dyslexia-friendliness in text 
- Implementation based on the British Dyslexia Association‚Äôs Style Guide
- Proof-of-concept evaluation of LLM outputs _(Check our paper)_
- Easily extensible and open-source
