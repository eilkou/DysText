# Dyslexia and AI

This is the repository of the proof-of-concept study:  
üìÑ *‚ÄúDyslexia and AI: Do Language Models Align with Dyslexic Style Guide Criteria?‚Äù*  
by Eleni Ilkou, Thomai Alexiou, Grigoris Antoniou, and Olga Viberg.

## Project Summary

This project uses **DysText**, a novel metric designed to evaluate and quantify the dyslexia-friendliness of text outputs, particularly from language models (LMs). It is built on accessibility principles from the **[British Dyslexia Association‚Äôs Dyslexia Style Guide](https://cdn.bdadyslexia.org.uk/uploads/documents/Advice/style-guide/BDA-Style-Guide-2023.pdf?v=1680514568)** and aims to support research into how well AI systems adhere to these criteria.

The study critically assesses popular LLMs on their ability to:
- Identify dyslexia-relevant stylistic features
- Generate accessible, dyslexia-friendly content

## üî¨ Research Context

Published in collaboration with:
- **L3S Research Center**, Leibniz University Hannover (Germany)
- **Aristotle University of Thessaloniki** (Greece)
- **Leeds Beckett University** (UK)
- **KTH Royal Institute of Technology** (Sweden)
