In 1054, the eastern branch of Christianity, led by the Patriarch of Constantinople (a title that because roughly equivalent to the western Church\u2019s pope), established its center in Constantinople and adopted the Greek language for its services. The western branch, under the pope, remained in Rome, becoming known as the Roman Catholic Church and continuing to use Latin. Following this split, known as the Great Schism, each branch of Christianity maintained a strict organizational hierarchy. The pope in Rome, for example, oversaw a huge bureaucracy led by cardinals, known as \u201cprinces of the church,\u201d who were followed by archbishops, bishops, and then priests. During this period, the Roman Church became the most powerful international organization in western Europe.\n Just as agrarian life depended on the seasons, village and family life revolved around the Church. The sacraments, or special ceremonies of the Church, marked every stage of life, from birth to maturation, marriage, and burial, and brought people into the church on a regular basis. As Christianity spread throughout Europe, it replaced pagan and animistic views, explaining supernatural events and forces of nature in its own terms. A benevolent God in heaven, creator of the universe and beyond the realm of nature and the known, controlled all events, warring against the force of darkness, known as the Devil or Satan, here on earth. Although ultimately defeated, Satan still had the power to trick humans and cause them to commit evil or sin. \n All events had a spiritual connotation. Sickness, for example, might be a sign that a person had sinned, while crop failure could result from the villagers\u2019 not saying their prayers. Penitents confessed their sins to the priest, who absolved them and assigned them penance to atone for their acts and save themselves from eternal damnation. Thus the parish priest held enormous power over the lives of his parishioners. \n Ultimately, the pope decided all matters of theology, interpreting the will of God to the people, but he also had authority over temporal matters. Because the Church had the ability to excommunicate people, or send a soul to hell forever, even monarchs feared to challenge its power. It was also the seat of all knowledge. Latin, the language of the Church, served as a unifying factor for a continent of isolated regions, each with its own dialect; in the early Middle Ages, nations as we know them today did not yet exist. The mostly illiterate serfs were thus dependent on those literate priests to read and interpret the Bible, the word of God, for them. ",
            "response": "After Rome fell, the Christian Church stayed united in its beliefs but split into western and eastern parts. In 1054, the eastern Christians, led by the Patriarch of Constantinople (similar to the pope in the west), made Constantinople their base and started using Greek for church services. The western Christians stayed in Rome under the pope's leadership and were known as the Roman Catholic Church; they continued using Latin.\n\nThis division is called the Great Schism. After this, both branches kept a strict order within their organizations. For example, in Rome, there was a large system managed by cardinals (high-ranking officials), followed by archbishops, bishops, and priests.\n\nDuring this time period, life in villages revolved around farming seasons and church activities. The Church held ceremonies marking important life events like birth or marriage which brought people together regularly. As Christianity spread across Europe it changed local beliefs about nature and supernatural forces with its own explanations\u2014a good God fighting against evil represented by Satan on Earth.\n\nEverything that happened had spiritual meaning\u2014illness might mean someone sinned; crop failures could be due to not praying enough. People confessed sins to priests who would forgive them and give penance tasks to avoid eternal punishment after death.\n\nThe pope had final say over religious teachings but also influenced worldly matters because he could excommunicate people\u2014banish them from church community forever\u2014which even kings feared.\n\nLatin linked different regions with various dialects since nations as we know today didn't exist yet during early Middle Ages times when most serfs couldn\u2019t read; they relied on literate priests for understanding Bible texts."

It was here King Solomon built the Temple in the tenth century BCE. It was here the Romans crucified Jesus in 33 CE, and from here, Christians maintain, he ascended into heaven, promising to return. From here, Muslims believe, Muhammad traveled to heaven in 621 to receive instructions about prayer. Thus claims on the area go deep, and emotions about it run high, among followers of all three faiths. Evidence exists that the three religions lived in harmony for centuries.\n In 1095, however, European Christians decided not only to retake the holy city from the Muslim rulers but also to conquer what they called the Holy Lands, an area that extended from modern-day Turkey in the north along the Mediterranean coast to the Sinai Peninsula and that was also held by Muslims. The Crusades had begun. \n Religious zeal motivated the knights who participated in the four Crusades. Adventure, the chance to win land and a title, and the Church\u2019s promise of wholesale forgiveness of sins also motivated many. The Crusaders, mostly French knights, retook Jerusalem in June 1099 amid horrific slaughter. A French writer who accompanied them recorded this eyewitness account: \u201cOn the top of Solomon\u2019s Temple, to which they had climbed in fleeing, many were shot to death with arrows and cast down headlong from the roof. Within this Temple, about ten thousand were beheaded. If you had been there, your feet would have been stained up to the ankles with the blood of the slain. What more shall I tell? Not one of them was allowed to live. They did not spare the women and children.\u201d A Muslim eyewitness also described how the conquerors stripped the temple of its wealth and looted private homes. \n In 1187, under the legendary leader Saladin, Muslim forces took back the city. Reaction from Europe was swift as King Richard I of England, the Lionheart, joined others to mount yet another action. The battle for the Holy Lands did not conclude until the Crusaders lost their Mediterranean stronghold at Acre (in present-day Israel) in 1291 and the last of the Christians left the area a few years later. \n The Crusades had lasting effects, both positive and negative. On the negative side, the wide-scale persecution of Jews began. Christians classed them with the infidel Muslims and labeled them \u201cthe killers of Christ.\u201d In the coming centuries, kings either expelled Jews from their kingdoms or forced them to pay heavy tributes for the privilege of remaining. Muslim-Christian hatred also festered, and intolerance grew.\n On the positive side, maritime trade between East and West expanded. As Crusaders experienced the feel of silk, the taste of spices, and the utility of porcelain, desire for these products created new markets for merchants. In particular, the Adriatic port city of Venice prospered enormously from trade with Islamic merchants. Merchants\u2019 ships brought Europeans valuable goods, traveling between the port cities of western Europe and the East from the tenth century on, along routes collectively labeled the Silk Road. From the days of the early adventurer Marco Polo, Venetian sailors had traveled to ports on the Black Sea and established their own colonies along the Mediterranean Coast. However, transporting goods along the old Silk Road was costly, slow, and unprofitable. Muslim middlemen collected taxes as the goods changed hands. Robbers waited to ambush the treasure-laden caravans. A direct water route to the East, cutting out the land portion of the trip, had to be found. As well as seeking a water passage to the wealthy cities in the East, sailors wanted to find a route to the exotic and wealthy Spice Islands in modern-day Indonesia, whose location was kept secret by Muslim rulers. Longtime rivals of Venice, the merchants of Genoa and Florence also looked west. ",

Historically, these groups often lived together peacefully.\n\nIn 1095, European Christians aimed to reclaim Jerusalem from Muslim control and expand their territory across what they called the Holy Lands\u2014from modern-day Turkey down to Sinai Peninsula.\n\nThe Crusades began then, driven by religious fervor among knights seeking adventure, land, titles, and forgiveness of sins promised by the Church. In June 1099 French knights captured Jerusalem with great violence as described by a French writer who witnessed many deaths at Solomon\u2019s Temple during this attack.\n\nMuslim forces led by Saladin recaptured Jerusalem in 1187. This prompted another European response led partly by England's Richard I (the Lionheart). The struggle over these lands continued until Crusaders lost their key stronghold at Acre in present-day Israel in 1291.\n\nThe Crusades had both positive and negative impacts: They spurred anti-Jewish actions labeling them alongside Muslims as enemies of Christianity which led to persecution including expulsions or heavy tributes imposed on Jewish communities; however Christian-Muslim relations worsened significantly too.\nOn a positive note though trade between East and West grew notably after Crusaders introduced Europeans more widely to Eastern goods like silk spices porcelain through Venice which thrived enormously due its dealings with Islamic traders despite challenges such as high costs slow travel times taxes levied by middlemen along Silk Road routes robberies targeting caravans prompting explorers seek direct sea routes bypassing land sections altogether aiming reach wealthy eastern cities Spice Islands whose locations were kept secret Muslim rulers while Genoa Florence explored westward alternatives"

The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle posited that some peoples were homunculi, or humanlike but not really people\u2014for instance, if they did not speak Greek. Both the Bible and the Koran have passages that address the treatment of enslaved people. Vikings who raided from Ireland to Russia brought back enslaved people of all nationalities. During the Middle Ages, traders from the interior of Africa brought enslaved people along well-established routes to sell them along the Mediterranean coast. Initially, slavers also brought enslaved Europeans to the Caribbean. Many of these were orphaned or homeless children captured in the cities of Ireland. The question is, when did slavery become based on race? This appears to have developed in the New World, with the introduction of gruelingly labor-intensive crops such as sugar and coffee. Unable to fill their growing need from the ranks of prisoners or indentured servants, the European colonists turned to African laborers. The Portuguese, although seeking a trade route to India, also set up forts along the West African coast for the purpose of exporting people to Europe. Historians believe that by the year 1500, 10 percent of the population of Lisbon and Seville consisted of Black enslaved people. Because of the influence of the Catholic Church, which frowned on the enslavement of Christians, European slave traders expanded their reach down the coast of Africa. \n When Europeans settled Brazil, the Caribbean, and North America, they thus established a system of racially based slavery. Here, the need for a massive labor force was greater than in western Europe. The land was ripe for growing sugar, coffee, rice, and ultimately cotton. To fulfill the ever-growing demand for these crops, large plantations were created. The success of these plantations depended upon the availability of a permanent, plentiful, identifiable, and skilled labor supply. As Africans were already familiar with animal husbandry as well as farming, had an identifying skin color, and could be readily supplied by the existing African slave trade, they proved the answer to this need.

Merchants then used these Atlantic outposts as debarkation points for subsequent journeys. From these strategic points, Portugal spread its empire down the western coast of Africa to the Congo, along the western coast of India, and eventually to Brazil on the eastern coast of South America. It also established trading posts in China and Japan. While the Portuguese didn\u2019t rule over an immense landmass, their strategic holdings of islands and coastal ports gave them almost unrivaled control of nautical trade routes and a global empire of trading posts during the 1400s. \n The travels of Portuguese traders to western Africa introduced them to the African slave trade, already brisk among African states. Seeing the value of this source of labor in growing the profitable crop of sugar on their Atlantic islands, the Portuguese soon began exporting enslaved Africans along with African ivory and gold. Sugar fueled the Atlantic slave trade, and the Portuguese islands quickly became home to sugar plantations. The Portuguese also traded these enslaved people, introducing much-needed human capital to other European nations. In the following years, as European exploration spread, slavery spread as well.

These boosters of colonization hoped to turn a profit\u2014whether by importing raw resources or providing new markets for English goods\u2014and spread Protestantism. The English migrants who actually made the journey, however, had different goals. In Chesapeake Bay, English migrants established Virginia and Maryland with a decidedly commercial orientation. Though the early Virginians at Jamestown hoped to find gold, they and the settlers in Maryland quickly discovered that growing tobacco was the only sure means of making money. Thousands of unmarried, unemployed, and impatient young Englishmen, along with a few Englishwomen, pinned their hopes for a better life on the tobacco fields of these two colonies. \n A very different group of English men and women flocked to the cold climate and rocky soil of New England, spurred by religious motives. Many of the Puritans crossing the Atlantic were people who brought families and children. Often they were following their ministers in a migration \u201cbeyond the seas,\u201d envisioning a new English Israel where reformed Protestantism would grow and thrive, providing a model for the rest of the Christian world and a counter to what they saw as the Catholic menace. While the English in Virginia and Maryland worked on expanding their profitable tobacco fields, the English in New England built towns focused on the church, where each congregation decided what was best for itself. The Congregational Church is the result of the Puritan enterprise in America. Many historians believe the fault lines separating what later became the North and South in the United States originated in the profound differences between the Chesapeake and New England colonies. \n The source of those differences lay in England\u2019s domestic problems. Increasingly in the early 1600s, the English state church\u2014the Church of England, established in the 1530s\u2014demanded conformity, or compliance with its practices, but Puritans pushed for greater reforms. By the 1620s, the Church of England began to see leading Puritan ministers and their followers as outlaws, a national security threat because of their opposition to its power. As the noose of conformity tightened around them, many Puritans decided to remove to New England. By 1640, New England had a population of twenty-five thousand. Meanwhile, many loyal members of the Church of England, who ridiculed and mocked Puritans both at home and in New England, flocked to Virginia for economic opportunity. \n The troubles in England escalated in the 1640s when civil war broke out, pitting Royalist supporters of King Charles I and the Church of England against Parliamentarians, the Puritan reformers and their supporters in Parliament. In 1649, the Parliamentarians gained the upper hand and, in an unprecedented move, executed Charles I. In the 1650s, therefore, England became a republic, a state without a king. English colonists in America closely followed these events. Indeed, many Puritans left New England and returned home to take part in the struggle against the king and the national church. Other English men and women in the Chesapeake colonies and elsewhere in the English Atlantic World looked on in horror at the mayhem the Parliamentarians, led by the Puritan insurgents, appeared to unleash in England. The turmoil in England made the administration and imperial oversight of the Chesapeake and New England colonies difficult, and the two regions developed divergent cultures. ",

However, the actual migrants had different plans.\n\nIn Chesapeake Bay, settlers founded Virginia and Maryland with a strong focus on business. Initially hoping to find gold in Jamestown, they soon realized that tobacco farming was a more reliable source of income. Many young unmarried men and some women from England saw these tobacco fields as their chance for a better life.\n\nIn contrast, New England attracted settlers motivated by religion rather than commerce. These were often families led by their ministers aiming to establish a new society based on reformed Protestant values which they hoped would serve as an example to others.\n\nThe differences between these regions can be traced back to issues in England itself during the early 1600s when the Church of England demanded conformity but faced resistance from Puritans seeking further reforms. By the 1620s, tensions increased as leading Puritan figures were seen as threats by the national church.\n\nBy 1640, around twenty-five thousand people lived in New England while many loyalists of the Church of England moved to Virginia seeking economic opportunities despite mocking Puritans both at home and abroad.\n\nConflict escalated into civil war during the 1640s between supporters of King Charles I along with his church against those supporting Parliamentarian reformers including many Puritans. The execution of Charles I in 1649 marked a significant moment leading to a republic phase without monarchy throughout most of the 1650s.\n\nThese events were closely watched by colonists who sometimes returned home influenced deeply by them; meanwhile others viewed them with dismay especially given how it complicated governance overseas causing divergent cultural developments within American colonies."

On the small island of Barbados, colonized in the 1620s, English planters first grew tobacco as their main export crop, but in the 1640s, they converted to sugarcane and began increasingly to rely on African enslaved people. In 1655, England wrestled control of Jamaica from the Spanish and quickly turned it into a lucrative sugar island, run on forced labor, for its expanding empire. While slavery was slower to take hold in the Chesapeake colonies, by the end of the seventeenth century, both Virginia and Maryland had also adopted chattel slavery\u2014which legally defined Africans as property and not people\u2014as the dominant form of labor to grow tobacco. Chesapeake colonists also enslaved Native people. \n When the first Africans arrived in Virginia in 1619, slavery\u2014which did not exist in England\u2014had not yet become an institution in colonial America. Many Africans worked as servants and, like their White counterparts, could acquire land of their own. Some Africans who converted to Christianity became free landowners with White servants. The change in the status of Africans in the Chesapeake to that of enslaved people occurred in the last decades of the seventeenth century. \n Bacon\u2019s Rebellion, an uprising of both White people and Black people who believed that the Virginia government was impeding their access to land and wealth and seemed to do little to clear the land of Native Americans, hastened the transition to African slavery in the Chesapeake colonies. The rebellion takes its name from Nathaniel Bacon, a wealthy young Englishman who arrived in Virginia in 1674. Despite an early friendship with Virginia\u2019s royal governor, William Berkeley, Bacon found himself excluded from the governor\u2019s circle of influential friends and councilors. He wanted land on the Virginia frontier, but the governor, fearing war with neighboring tribes, forbade further expansion. Bacon marshaled others, especially former indentured servants who believed the governor was limiting their economic opportunities and denying them the right to own tobacco farms. Bacon\u2019s followers believed Berkeley\u2019s frontier policy didn\u2019t protect English settlers enough. Worse still in their eyes, Governor Berkeley tried to keep peace in Virginia by signing treaties with various local Native peoples. Bacon and his followers, who saw all Native peoples as an obstacle to their access to land, pursued a policy of extermination. \n Tensions between the English and the Native peoples in the Chesapeake colonies led to open conflict. In 1675, war broke out when Susquehannock warriors attacked settlements on Virginia\u2019s frontier, killing English planters and destroying English plantations, including one owned by Bacon. In 1676, Bacon and other Virginians attacked the Susquehannock without the governor\u2019s approval. When Berkeley ordered Bacon\u2019s arrest, Bacon led his followers to Jamestown, forced the governor to flee to the safety of Virginia\u2019s eastern shore, and then burned the city. The civil war known as Bacon\u2019s Rebellion, a vicious struggle between supporters of the governor and those who supported Bacon, ensued. Reports of the rebellion traveled back to England, leading Charles II to dispatch both royal troops and English commissioners to restore order in the tobacco colonies. By the end of 1676, Virginians loyal to the governor gained the upper hand, executing several leaders of the rebellion. Bacon escaped the hangman\u2019s noose, instead dying of dysentery. The rebellion fizzled in 1676, but Virginians remained divided as supporters of Bacon continued to harbor grievances over access to Native land.\n Bacon\u2019s Rebellion helped to catalyze the creation of a system of racial slavery in the Chesapeake colonies. At the time of the rebellion, indentured servants made up the majority of laborers in the region. Wealthy White people worried over the presence of this large class of laborers and the relative freedom they enjoyed, as well as the alliance that Black and White servants had forged in the course of the rebellion. Replacing indentured servitude with Black slavery diminished these risks, alleviating the reliance on White indentured servants, who were often dissatisfied and troublesome, and creating a caste of racially defined laborers whose movements were strictly controlled. It also lessened the possibility of further alliances between Black and White workers. Racial slavery even served to heal some of the divisions between wealthy and poor White people, who could now unite as members of a \u201csuperior\u201d racial group.\n While colonial laws in the tobacco colonies had made slavery a legal institution before Bacon\u2019s Rebellion, new laws passed in the wake of the rebellion severely curtailed Black freedom and laid the foundation for racial slavery. Virginia passed a law in 1680 prohibiting free Black people and enslaved people from bearing arms, banning Black people from congregating in large numbers, and establishing harsh punishments for enslaved people who assaulted Christians or sought freedom. Two years later, another Virginia law stipulated that all Africans brought to the colony would be enslaved for life. Thus, the increasing reliance on enslaved people in the tobacco colonies\u2014and the draconian laws instituted to control them\u2014not only helped planters meet labor demands, but also served to assuage English fears of further uprisings and alleviate class tensions between rich and poor White people.

The status of Africans shifted towards enslavement towards the end of that century.\n\nBacon\u2019s Rebellion was sparked by frustrations among both Black and White individuals over perceived barriers set up by Virginia's government against their chances at land ownership and wealth accumulation; they also felt little was done about removing Native Americans from desired lands. This rebellion accelerated African enslavement practices within Chesapeake colonies.\n\nTensions between English settlers and local Native tribes escalated into open conflict around this period too; notably marked by attacks such as those led by Susquehannock warriors which resulted in significant losses for English settlers including Bacon himself whose plantation was destroyed during one attack leading him to retaliate without official sanction resulting ultimately in his leadership of armed resistance culminating with forcing Governor Berkeley out of Jamestown which he then burned down before dying not through execution but dysentery ending his uprising known today simply as Bacon's Rebellion though its effects lingered particularly influencing racial policies thereafter.\n\nThis event helped solidify racial slavery systems within Chesapeake regions where previously majority labor forces comprised indentured servants now replaced increasingly under racially motivated legal frameworks aimed at preventing similar future alliances across races thereby easing class tensions amongst Whites while embedding deeper systemic racial divisions moving forward."

Slaves are the Negroes, and their Posterity, following the condition of the Mother, according to the Maxim, partus sequitur ventrem [status follows the womb]. They are call\u2019d Slaves, in respect of the time of their Servitude, because it is for Life. Servants, are those which serve only for a few years, according to the time of their Indenture, or the Custom of the Country. The Custom of the Country takes place upon such as have no Indentures.

The Male-Servants, and Slaves of both Sexes, are employed together in Tilling and Manuring the Ground, in Sowing and Planting Tobacco, Corn, &c. Some Distinction indeed is made between them in their Cloaths, and Food; but the Work of both, is no other than what the Overseers, the Freemen, and the Planters themselves do. Sufficient Distinction is also made between the Female-Servants, and Slaves; for a White Woman is rarely or never put to work in the Ground, if she be good for any thing else: And to Discourage all Planters from using any Women so, their Law imposes the heaviest Taxes upon Female Servants working in the Ground, while it suffers all other White Women to be absolutely exempted: Whereas on the other hand, it is a common thing to work a Woman Slave out of Doors; nor does the Law make any Distinction in her Taxes, whether her Work be Abroad, or at Home.\u201d \n According to Robert Beverley, what are the differences between the servants and the enslaved?

He wrote about the differences between white servants and enslaved Black people in his book, \"History and Present State of Virginia,\" published in 1705.\n\nIn his writing, Beverley explained that there were two types of workers: those who were slaves for life and those who were servants temporarily. The slaves included Black people and their children, following the rule that one's status was inherited from the mother. These individuals were called 'slaves' because they had to work for their entire lives without freedom.\n\nOn the other hand, servants worked only for a specific number of years as determined by their contract or local customs. If no contract existed, young servants under nineteen had to have their age assessed by a court which then decided how long they would serve \u2013 until they turned twenty-four. Those judged over nineteen served only five more years.\n\nBoth male servants and slaves worked together on farms doing tasks like planting tobacco and corn. Although both groups did similar work, there was some difference in how they were treated regarding clothing and food.\nAdditionally, female workers received different treatment based on whether they were white or enslaved; white women rarely did fieldwork if capable of other tasks due to laws imposing heavy taxes on planters using white women for such labor while exempting others from these duties.\nConversely, it was common for female slaves to do outdoor work without any tax distinctions based on where they worked.\n\nThe key differences highlighted by Beverley include:\n1) Duration of service: Servants typically served according to contracts while slavery was lifelong.\n2) Legal protections: Temporary servants could appeal conditions through courts whereas enslaved individuals lacked legal recourse affecting working conditions or duration.\n3) Treatment based on gender: Laws differentiated between female workers significantly with biases favoring white women over enslaved ones concerning physical labor expectations and taxation related penalties imposed upon employers utilizing them outdoors."

Settled largely by waves of Puritan families in the 1630s, New England had a religious orientation from the start. In England, reform-minded men and women had been calling for greater changes to the English national church since the 1580s. These reformers, who followed the teachings of John Calvin and other Protestant reformers, were called Puritans because of their insistence on \u201cpurifying\u201d the Church of England of what they believed to be un-scriptural, especially Catholic elements that lingered in its institutions and practices. \n Many who provided leadership in early New England were learned ministers who had studied at Cambridge or Oxford but who, because they had questioned the practices of the Church of England, had been deprived of careers by the king and his officials in an effort to silence all dissenting voices. Other Puritan leaders, such as the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, John Winthrop, came from the privileged class of English gentry. These well-to-do Puritans and many thousands more left their English homes not to establish a land of religious freedom, but to practice their own religion without persecution. Puritan New England offered them the opportunity to live as they believed the Bible demanded. In their \u201cNew\u201d England, they set out to create a model of reformed Protestantism, a new English Israel. \n The conflict generated by Puritanism had divided English society, because the Puritans demanded reforms that undermined the traditional festive culture. For example, they denounced popular pastimes like bear-baiting\u2014letting dogs attack a chained bear\u2014which were often conducted on Sundays when people had a few leisure hours. In the culture where William Shakespeare had produced his masterpieces, Puritans called for an end to the theater, censuring playhouses as places of decadence. Indeed, the Bible itself became part of the struggle between Puritans and James I, who headed the Church of England. Soon after ascending the throne, James commissioned a new version of the Bible in an effort to stifle Puritan reliance on the Geneva Bible, which followed the teachings of John Calvin and placed God\u2019s authority above the monarch\u2019s. The King James Version, published in 1611, instead emphasized the majesty of kings. \n During the 1620s and 1630s, the conflict escalated to the point where the state church prohibited Puritan ministers from preaching.

Lord North took his place and wanted to find a better way to work with the colonists. He got Parliament to remove all taxes from the Townshend duties except for tea. The groups set up under these acts, like the American Board of Customs Commissioners and courts that dealt with sea law issues, stayed as they were.\n\nFor those against the Townshend Acts for years, taking some away seemed like a big win.

In the warm weather, doors and windows might be opened to the outside, and work stopped when it was too dark to see. \n Work in factories proved to be quite different.

It is, however, locally a chronic problem, and in many areas a potential hazard under changing cultivation practices. Soil erosion is intimately associated with problems of water control and desertification, and it is thus convenient to consider both together.\n Over much of tropical Africa the annual water supply from precipitation is less than the amount of water most crop plants would transpire if adequately supplied with moisture. Furthermore, over much of this area the rainfall is unreliable in amount and occurrence, both seasonally and annually. Also it is commonly very intense. Thus conservation measures must involve efficient use of the available moisture, and the prevention of the adverse effect of intense rainfall, such as flash floods. A special section has been created in this chapter to discuss the drought at the Sahel region.\n Maintaining a plant cover and mulching, separately or together, constitute one approach to the problem, but the preservation of useless plants simply as a conservation measure involves the waste of moisture which might otherwise go the crop plant, and is feasible only in areas where the water supply is more or less adequate to the being grown. Mulching with dead plant matter is also not usually practicable, since there are other more pressing uses for such materials as straw, plant stems and leaves, which might be used for conservation of this type. Artificial mulches, such as bitumen-in-water, though practicable, are not usually economically or technically possible in the present socio-economic situation in areas where such measures are most needed.\n Contour and tie-ridging effectively achieve conservation of water supplies, and a diminution of runoff velocities. The combination of the two has proved their worth. These measures offer simple and satisfactory ways of controlling water use and preventing soil erosion, but soil differences still need to be taken into account. The importance of such measures cannot be overemphasized, and always involve major schemes of rehabilitation, embracing engineering works, afforestation, considerable modifications of traditional agricultural practices, even of settlement patterns and land apportionment. These imply considerable expense of money and of expertise which could otherwise be used for agricultural improvement, rather than for arresting the effects of past malpractices. Rainfall variability, and prolonged drought have been major environmental issues disturbing the African continent. On the more western part, while the Sahel region has had a long reputation of extreme drought conditions, most West-African countries have historically suffered from environmental challenges. For the past thirty years, inconsistencies in rainfall and high levels of variability have negatively affected agriculture. Rainfall provides the moist nature of soil and aids in its aeration encouraging massive agriculture production. Concerning rice production, it has had the tendency of causing fluctuations in production in countries like Sierra Leone and Gambia. The major climatic condition that has negatively impacted the agricultural activities of the West African regions is drought. This environmental phenomenon has persisted since the 1960s with the early 1980s and 70s witnessing the worst conditions of it. This drought had systematically altered the kind of food crops cultivated in the regions whiles drastically reducing the production of other crops. Examples include sorghum, millet and rice.In Gambia, farmers had claimed that, the droughts had altered the rains negatively. Rainfall in this country and other Sahelian states has being the main source of irrigational water for their crops. Considerably, Agricultural produce had increased in the 1950s and 60s due to the favourable rains in this period, however the late 1960s and early 70s saw the decline of the rains. In the southern part of the country, farmers claimed rains in the month June of the 70s were low comparing it to that of the 1950s. The rains in the latter had only last for a month. The major crop which has been affected by these droughts is rice. Rice has been the major staple of countries like Sierra Leone, Gambia and most Sahelian States. In Gambia about 20-30% of lands are converted to upland rice cultivation. Primarily, its production has been dominated by women serving as major source of income. Since the inception of this environmental phenomenon, rice production has declined approximately half of what use to be produced. This has led to most indigenes relying on exported ones. The major setback here is the reduced rains which has also in turn reduced run-off to the main lands of rice plantations. Generally, rivers have also dried due to this same issue.\n Other major staples which have been affected by the drought are millet, sorghum and groundnuts. The cultivation patterns of these crops have increasingly been determined by natural rains. With the advent of the drought, Men have opted for Lands which are rich and moisture which can sustain the cultivation of the crops. This action has led to increasing degrading activities in regions like Burkina Faso, Mali and Gambia. The desire to farm in areas closer to water bodies has also led to water pollution. Statistically, poor and erratic rainfall in many years since 1968 has brought about reduced yields of these crops in the countries and has reduced the potential germination of seeds. Particularly the seeds of millet and sorghum have suffered a great deal from this instance.\n Ghana just like many other tropical countries is very much vulnerable to climate change and variability. An estimated 35 percent of the total land mass is desert and since the 1980s the has been increasing desertification of the northern part of the country. Desertification in Ghana is currently estimated to be proceeding at a rate of 20,000 hectares per annum thereby compromising water resource. n northern Ghana, these farmers are usually involved in the cultivation of staple grains including maize, rice, millet, sorghum, soybean, cowpea and groundnut, and also engage in the rearing of small ruminants such as sheep and goat.",
            "response": "Soil erosion isn't a widespread issue in West Africa with traditional farming methods. However, it becomes a significant problem locally and potentially hazardous as agricultural practices change. Soil erosion is closely linked to water management issues and desertification, making it practical to address them together.\n\nIn much of tropical Africa, the yearly rainfall doesn't meet the water needs of most crops if they had enough moisture. Often, this rainfall is not only unpredictable in timing and amount but also very heavy. Therefore, conservation efforts must focus on using available moisture efficiently and preventing problems caused by heavy rains like flash floods. A specific section in this chapter discusses drought conditions in the Sahel region.\n\nUsing plant cover and mulch helps tackle these issues but keeping non-beneficial plants just for conservation can waste water that could benefit crops instead\u2014this approach works mainly where there's adequate water supply for crops being grown. Using dead plant materials as mulch often isn\u2019t feasible because they have other important uses like feeding livestock or building materials.\n\nContouring land and creating tie-ridges are effective at conserving water and reducing runoff speed; combining these techniques has proven valuable. These simple methods help manage water use effectively while addressing soil erosion concerns; however, differences between soil types still need consideration when implementing such strategies.\n\nThe importance of these measures cannot be overstated\u2014they require major rehabilitation projects including engineering works, reforestation activities, substantial changes to traditional farming practices\u2014even altering settlement patterns and how land is divided up\u2014all involving significant financial costs and expertise which might otherwise aid agricultural development rather than merely correcting past mistakes.\n\nRainfall variability along with prolonged droughts pose serious environmental challenges across Africa particularly affecting agriculture over decades due to inconsistent rainfalls impacting crop yields negatively especially rice production causing fluctuations notably in Sierra Leone & Gambia since 1960s through early 1980s experiencing severe drought conditions changing food crop cultivation drastically reducing output levels e.g., sorghum millet rice etc leading farmers especially from Gambia reporting adverse impacts on their cropping schedules relying heavily on seasonal rains now becoming unreliable forcing reliance on imported rice due increased failure rates local productions hence reduced run-offs affecting irrigation potentials significantly drying rivers further complicating situations\n\nOther staple foods like millet sorghum groundnuts equally affected by ongoing drought trends prompting shifts towards more fertile moist lands near aquatic sources inadvertently increasing pollution risks alongside degradation activities noted within Burkina Faso Mali Gambia regions driven by necessity adapt natural precipitation cycles severely hampering seed germination prospects particularly those belonging millet sorghum varieties\n\nGhana among several tropical nations faces heightened vulnerability climate change variations approximately thirty-five percent total landmass turning into desert since 1980s witnessing accelerated northern part country desertification processes estimated progressing twenty thousand hectares annually compromising essential water resources thus impacting local communities predominantly engaged cultivating staple grains maize rice millet sorghum soybean cowpea groundnut alongside small-scale livestock rearing sheep goat operations"

The Jakhanke Islamization effort indeed have borne rich fruit! But let us begin by addressing the brass tacks: who were the Jakhanke? Why do they deserve attention in our study of the spread of Islam in West Africa?\n The highly regarded Gambian historian Lamin Sanneh who is also the leading authority on the Jakhanke calls the Jakhanke a \u2018specialized caste\u2019 of Muslim clerics and educators. \u2018Caste\u2019 gives them an aura of belonging to a bigger group, the Serahuli ethnic group also called Soninke in other writings. Today, they are erroneously categorized as Mandinka. They speak a dialect of Mandinka, but their \u2018Mandikanization\u2019 was largely because they were hosted by Mandinka chiefs when the Jakhanke moved from present day Republic of Mali to the Senegambia region. \u2018Clerics and educators\u2019 indicate their profession as literate and therefore able to proselytize and do missionary work. Apparently, the Jakhanke who are found in the Senegambia region today in large numbers do not put much premium on their ethnic origins but rather on their work as propagators of Islam in the past 800 years.\n This is exactly why the Jakhanke should interest us. They started a peaceful propagation of Islam in the Senegambia region. This is all the more relevant as we write today because of the rampant violence associated with Islam in many parts of the world. Much of the subsequent styles, and techniques associated with the peaceful spread of Islam in Senegambia is their creation. In a nutshell, they set the standards for missionary work.\n What were these standards? Chiefly, they professed the peaceful path to Islam. They did not raise the sword to spread the religion. They resorted to more peaceful methods such as establishing Koranic schools and mosques, upgrading of mosques, holding sessions on Koranic exegesis, preservation of holy sites where yearly Islamic gatherings take place and being itinerant traders who took Islam to their clients and customers. But just as they had methods, they also had tactics! For example, they believed in numbers and therefore were keen to multiply their talibes or disciples. The disciples having gone through years of tutelage, would be allowed to disperse and then mass up new disciples themselves. Through massification, the Jakhanke helped to strengthen their religion. Also, they had a tactic of withdrawing into enclaves far from the maddening crowds, so to speak. Generally, Jakhanke needed the quietude of the monastery and thus were very good at establishing theocratic entities sometimes deep in the Senegambian Savannah, where they developed self sustaining communities dedicated to Islamic scholarship and renditions. Sutukuho, Sutukung, in The Gambia and Niokhlo and Suna Karantba in Casamance are extant examples of such religious villages.\n So far absent in our discussion is the figure of Alhaji Salim Suwareh, the founder of the Jakhanke Islamic movement we have discussed above. He was a central in the success of the Jakhanke missionary work and therefore deserves our brief attention. His early life is shrouded in mystery, but a few strands deserve serious attention and are revealing. He died around 1500 and reputedly made seven pilgrimages to Mecca where he had relatives and lived before relocating to Black Africa to spread Islam, settling in the Jaka region of Masina, in present day Mali. Hence the name of his people Jakankhe, meaning in Mandinka \u2018those who hail from Jaka\u2019. When he completed his seventh hajj, he returned to Africa and stayed. He led his people from Jaka Masina to Jaka Bambuku. When the animist ruler of Bambuku became hostile, Suwareh did as the prophet of Islam did when Meccans started to throw stones at him: flee into exile. Suwareh led his band of talibes towards present day Senegambia. The historian Professor Sanneh writes that since this hijra or flight like movement, Jakhanke \u2018have been united by a close bond of solidarity based on fidelity to Suwareh characterized by bonds of solidarity\u2019.\n So dedicated were the Jakhanke to the spirit of peaceful spread of Islam that when a Serahuli religious hothead, Momodou Lamin Drammeh(1835-1887) opted to wage war to convert Bundu (eastern Senegal) into Islam, the Jakhanke disowned him and fled further down to present eastern Gambia. His swashbuckling style was quite in contrast to their orderly ways of Islamization! Without bearing the sword, the Jakhanke were able to fasten the spread and reform of Islam in contrast to the jihadist like Drammeh, Umar Taal, or Maba Jahou Bah. The paradox here may not be obvious but is palpable: how Jakhanke whose mentor, Suwareh, lived and had relatives in Mecca could have disavowed the uncompromising Wahabi doctrine to espouse the \u2018path of accommodation\u2019?\n To conclude therefore, what is the significance of the Jakhanke movement? Simply put, the Jakhanke epitomized peaceful and community led spread of Islam which made a deep impact on the recipient societies of Islam as the way of peace. The present day bomb throwers who claim to spread this religion by doing so may want to learn a lesson or two from the Jakhanke movement which started over 500 years ago ",
            "response": "A history of Islam in West Africa must include the Jakhanke Islamic Movement. It started in the 12th century with Alhajj Salim Suwareh, a charismatic scholar. He spread Islam across what are now Mali, Guinea, Senegal, and The Gambia\u2014today's most Islamized countries in West Africa.\n\nThe Jakhanke were known for their peaceful methods of spreading Islam. They did not use violence but focused on education and community building. They set up Koranic schools and mosques, held teaching sessions, preserved holy sites for annual gatherings, and used trade to share their beliefs.\n\nLamin Sanneh, a respected Gambian historian and expert on the Jakhanke describes them as a 'specialized caste' within the Serahuli ethnic group (also called Soninke). Today they are often mistakenly grouped with Mandinka people because they speak a dialect of Mandinka after being hosted by Mandinka chiefs when moving from Mali to Senegambia.\n\nTheir focus was not on ethnicity but rather their role as educators and propagators of Islam over 800 years. This is particularly relevant today given global concerns about violence linked to religion; the Jakhanke represent an alternative model based on peace.\n\nAlhaji Salim Suwareh played a central role in this movement\u2019s success. His life remains largely unknown except that he died around 1500 after making seven pilgrimages to Mecca where he had family before settling his followers in Masina (present-day Mali).\n\nWhen faced with hostility from local rulers similar to challenges faced by Prophet Muhammad himself who fled persecution\u2014Suwareh led his followers toward present-day Senegambia establishing communities dedicated to Islamic scholarship like Sutukuho or Sutukung in The Gambia or Niokholo and Suna Karantba in Casamance.\n\nDespite pressures during periods such as when Momodou Lamin Drammeh tried converting Bundu into an Islamic state through war during 1835-1887\u2014the Jakhanke maintained their commitment to peaceful propagation disassociating themselves from violent approaches unlike other figures like Umar Taal or Maba Jahou Bah who pursued more militant strategies despite having connections back to Mecca just like Suwareh.\n\nIn conclusion: What makes the Jakhanke movement significant? Their approach exemplifies how community-led efforts can peacefully integrate religious beliefs deeply impacting societies which contrasts sharply against modern extremist tactics claiming religious justification yet lacking historical continuity seen within movements such as those initiated by figures like Suwareh over five centuries ago."

The Portuguese had been sailing the coasts of Morocco and Western Sahara since 1413, when they captured the Moroccan city of Ceuta [still a Spanish city today]. Between 1413 and the 1440s, the Portuguese established several fortified settlements along the Moroccan coast, especially at Arzila, Mogador (now Essaouira), Safi, and Tangier; they retained a strong presence in Morocco until 1578, when the Portuguese King Sebasti\u00e3o I and much of the Portuguese nobility were killed at the Battle of Alc\u00e1cer-Quibir. By 1471, West African leaders between the coasts of Senegal and Ghana had established commercial and diplomatic connections with Portuguese traders [major early sites of trade and settlement were on the Gambia river, Bugendo on the S\u00e3o Domingos river in Guinea-Bissau, and Sierra Leone].\n For the next 150 years, West African rulers and traders came across the Portuguese more than any other European nation. [There were also smaller trading missions led by the English and the French, but these were less frequent]. In the beginning, the Portuguese main motivations were: 1, an interest in the extensive gold production of Bono-Mansu and the Akan states; 2, competition with the Ottoman Empire to access this gold [the Ottomans had captured Constantinople in 1453, prompting a crisis in Christian Europe]; 3, the desire to find a trade route to markets in India around the Cape of Good Hope; 4, ever increasingly, the trade in enslaved persons.\n By the 1590s, the Dutch began to rival the Portuguese as the major European trading nation in Africa. Their ships were bigger and better, and the goods they traded with African political leaders were of much higher quality. The Dutch had captured many of the main Portuguese trading stations in West Africa by 1650, especially at Gor\u00e9e in Senegal (in 1621), at Elmina in Ghana (in 1637), and at Luanda in Angola (in 1641). Initially the Dutch were mainly interested in textiles, animal hides [for the leather industry], and ivory, but by the middle of the 17th century they too turned to slave trading. The Dutch interest in slave trading dates to the 1620s and the capture of half of the Brazilian colonies from the Portuguese. From 1630 to 1654 the Dutch controlled the northern part of Brazil, and the associated sugar plantations which used the labour of enslaved persons; their growing colonial interests drove their interest in slave trading, which took over in the second half of the 18th century.\n In the second half of the 17th century, other European nations would follow this pattern. Danish, English, French, German, and Swedish traders established factories at various points in West Africa, and this pattern of African-European trade and interaction deepened.\n This chapter looks especially at the early period of African-European interaction, to 1650, before the trade in enslaved persons came to predominate in trade.

By 1448, some of their people had sailed up the Gambia river as far as the major trading town of Kantora, not far east of what is today Basse Santa Su [in the far east of the country; Kantora was then a major centre for the trans-Saharan trade]. By the mid-1450s, there was trade with the Wolof state of Kajoor on the coast, and the Bijag\u00f3s Islands off the coast of Guinea-Bissau had entered discussions with European traders. The initial language of communication was probably Arabic: Arabic speakers were many in Portugal in the 15th century, where Granada was still as Islamic kingdom in Spain, and of course was widely spoken in many parts of West Africa. One sailor described in 1456 how the Bijag\u00f3s was the last place where the African peoples shared a language with the Portuguese sailors, and so this was also probably the southernmost extent of Arab and Trans-Saharan trade at that time. The Cape Verde Islands were first reached probably in 1456 [a lively discussion exists among Capeverdean historians as to whether there was already a population; archaeological evidence is inconclusive, but the islands may have been a salt depot for Saharan states], and the coastline of Ghana followed in around 1471.\n The coastline of Ghana was different because it was so close to the gold mines of the Akan forests. Soon Akan traders sold gold informally to the Portuguese. The Portuguese state wanted its share, and so the Portuguese sent a large fleet in 1481 and negotiated with Kwamena Ansa, ruler at Edina [now called Elmina], to build a fortress. When the negotiations were concluded [after a highly tense stand-off, which began when the Portuguese tried to build their fort at the site of a holy shrine], the fortress at Elmina was built, and still remains on what became known as the Gold Coast. It would later change hands and become a Dutch fortress in the 17th century; and in time the Dutch and English would be the main European nations trading in Ghana.\n Because there was so much commerce on the Gold Coast, many different Akan rulers were keen to expand their trading connections. The Portuguese built forts in other locations along the Gold Coast, such as Axim and Komenda, many of which were completed by 1500. In time there would be many more forts, almost every few miles along the Gold Coast; some would be specialists in the gold trade, and others, such as Anishan, in exporting the corn which was also in high demand from European ships. It would not be until the 18th century that the slave trade would come to predominate on the Gold Coast.\n Meantime, other rulers from West and West-Central Africa were making contact with the Portuguese. Oba Ozolua of Benin received Portuguese visitors in 1485, and the Atlantic trading post of Gwat\u00f3n was founded around 1490. Benin initially sold malaguetta peppers to the Portuguese, but after the sea route to India was established in 1499, Benin\u2019s peppers became less in demand in Europe. The Portuguese tried to establish a trade in enslaved persons from Benin to the gold suppliers in Elmina, but the Oba refused. Over the 16th century, Benin\u2019s relations with the Portuguese declined, until in the early 17th century the Obas renewed links with European traders given the Dutch demand for the cloth produced in Benin. Throughout the 17th century cloth remained the main export of Benin, and the ambassy cloths were traded regularly to Elmina, and as far afield as Brazil. However demand fell in the late 17th century, as imports of luxury cloths from India grew. This meant that by the 18th century Benin\u2019s Obas had finally to turn to the trade in enslaved persons to preserve and renew the power of Edo and the Benin state.\n The Portuguese continued to voyage south after Benin, reaching the mouth of the Kongo river and establishing relations with the manikongo at Mbanza Kongo [the capital of Kongo], Nzika Nkuwu. The island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 was settled by 1485, and many BaKongo peoples were taken there as enslaved persons to work on the sugar plantations. In 1491, Nzika Nkuwu converted to Christianity and took the name Joao I. This led also to connections between Kongo and Elmina through S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, which traded with both. Indeed, by the 1510s, traders from Benin were mentioned as present at the Kongolese port of Mpinda in a letter written in Portuguese by the new manikongo Afonso I (1509-46). By the 1510s, therefore, many different peoples of West Africa and their rulers had established connections with the Portuguese. Some, such as those at Benin and Elmina had connections further south, to Kongo. African rulers hoped to expand their trading contacts; and at times to obtain military support against rivals, as was the case with both Benin (who fought a major battle with Portuguese support against Nupe, in 1516) and in civil wars in Jolof and Kongo.",

Around this same year, Cape Verde was first visited by Europeans; debates continue about whether these islands were already inhabited or served merely as salt depots for Saharan states before European arrival.\n\nThe Ghanaian coastline attracted attention around 1471 due to its proximity to gold-rich Akan forests. Initially, Akan traders informally sold gold directly to Portuguese merchants who soon sought formal arrangements through state intervention. In 1481 a large fleet arrived and negotiated successfully with Kwamena Ansa (the ruler at Edina) for permission to build Elmina Fortress after tense negotiations over a sacred site dispute.\n\nElmina became pivotal on what came to be known as Gold Coast\u2014a region rich in commerce leading many Akan rulers eager to expand trade relations further by building additional forts like Axim and Komenda completed mostly by 1500.

Prior to advent of the Christian missionaries and indeed well into the pre-independence period, most sick people depended for cure upon concoction herbs and roots and barks of trees. Although modern scientific research has confirmed the medicinal properties of these concoctions, traditional medical practice had several shortcomings. Preventive medicine was hardly known; the result was that epidemics of different kinds were frequent. Also, the traditional doctors more often than not could not diagnose illness accurately. They often attributed natural ailments to supernatural causes and resorted to mystic cults to appease the \u2018unknown\u2019 spirit, before applying medicine to the sick person. They also prescribed many taboos which, in the light of modern medical science, had no relation whatever with the illness being treated. However, the early missionaries established medical centres, at first at their mission posts, and later far and wide, to attend to the sick. In due course leprosariums and orphanages were built to supplement their medical services.\n For instance, in Nigeria, one of the first groups of missionaries to introduce organised medical services were the Roman Catholics. Father Jean Marie Coquard, operating in and from Abeokuta for forty years, was renowned among the Egba as a priest and surgeon in the second half of the nineteenth century. In 1892, the Church Missionary Society opened the Iyi Enu Hospital in Onitsha which is today a leading hospital in Anambra state. In 1902 the Methodists opened a clinic at Igbo-Ora. Meanwhile, the Scottish missionary, Mary Slessor, had established a reputation in the Cross River area as a nurse. Through hard work and persuasion she succeeded in stopping the practice among the people of killing twins. Another important missionary doctor was J. R. Stephen who for many years headed a missionary hospital at Ilesha. As happened in other West African countries, many more mission-sponsored hospitals were founded in the course of the twentieth century. Also, Christian missionaries in Ghana were as zealous as their counterparts in Nigeria in pioneering medical services. The Roman Catholic Sisters provided medical care in the Upper and Northern Regions of the country before the government started to provide hospitals and clinics in the regional and district headquarters. In the Western Region, the Catholic Sisters running a hospital at Eikwe specialized in maternity cases, and like Slessor in Nigeria succeeded in stamping out the practice of killing twins at birth. Other Roman Catholic hospitals were built in all the nine regions of the country; including those at Asikuma and Foso (Central Region), Akyem Swedru (Eastern Region), Berekum (BrongAhafo), Maase (Asante Region) and Anfoega (Volta Region). The Presbyterians, also, opened hospitals in several parts of the country, including the one at Agogo in Asante-Akyem.

For example, there wasn't much preventive medicine, so epidemics happened often.\n\nTraditional healers sometimes couldn\u2019t tell what the sickness was correctly.

The economic impact of the war on West Africa was tremendous and far reaching, resulting in (1) an increased economic importance of West Africa to the world market. Europe began to depend more on tropical Africa to supply rubber, cotton, cocoa, palm produce, and groundnuts. Thus, West African colonies increased the production of these cash crops. In Nigeria for instance, value of exports rose from 10,300,00 pounds in 1931 to 24,600,00 pounds in 1946. Imports rose from 6,800,00 pounds to 19,800,00 pounds during the same period. (2) West African workers developed grievances as a result of the colonial government introducing price control, controlling marketing of export crops, introducing wage ceilings, and pressuring for more production, Moreover, African businessmen were excluded from the import and export trade which was now reserved only for European firms. (3) The rise of trade unions emerged as a result of the rise of the cost of living without corresponding rise in wages. This provided stimulus for organizational activity among the labor class. In Nigeria the number of trade unions rose from 5 to 70, and the Nigerian Trade Union Congress (1943) became central coordinating body. Trade unions cooperated closely with nationalist leaders in pressing for the end of colonialism.

Lagos rose from 100,000 in 1939 to 230,00 in 1950. Accra rose from 70,000 in 1941 to 166,00 in 1948. Towns became overcrowded with discontented job-seeker and workers who witnessed whites living in comfortable, spacious European reservations with paved streets and beautiful lawns and gardens, while they were living in slums. The people therefore became receptive to nationalist appeal and would become the first willing recruits into militant nationalist movement. (5) War gave impetus to education in West Africa. Because of increased prosperity resulting from war time economic boom, more parents could afford to send children to school, literacy spread, and newspaper readership increased. Newspapers became a powerful tool in hands of nationalists to push for political, economic and social development. (6) In spite of more job opportunities, thousands of school-leavers remained unemployed. For the first time, West African cities developed a new class of unemployed people especially in cities. They became disgruntled and blamed colonial government and European firms for their plight. They were easily won over by nationalist agitators. (7) The most decisive factor that accelerated the growth of nationalism was however the return of ex-servicemen. Over 176,000 men from British West Africa served in British colonial army during war. After war, large numbers of survivors returned. About 100,000 returned to Nigeria, and 65,000 retuned to Ghana from the Middle East, East Africa, Burma and India. Ex-service men had seen life in more developed countries and enjoyed high living standards in army. They had seen the strength of nationalist movements in Asia and fought side by side with Europeans and seen weaknesses which exposed the myth of European racial superiority. They came home with burning desire for better life for themselves and people and urgent demand for extension to Africa of freedom for which many of them had fought and died. Many joined ranks of militant nationalists.",
            "response": "World War II greatly increased nationalism and weakened imperialism. The war had a significant economic effect on West Africa, which was extensive and impactful, leading to several key changes:\n\n1. **Economic Role**: West Africa became more crucial to the global market. Europe relied increasingly on tropical African products like rubber, cotton, cocoa, palm products, and groundnuts. For example, in Nigeria the export value jumped from 10.3 million pounds in 1931 to 24.6 million pounds in 1946; imports also rose significantly during this period.\n\n2. **Worker Grievances**: New policies by colonial governments\u2014such as price controls and wage caps\u2014frustrated West African workers. Local businessmen were pushed out of import-export activities that became exclusive to European companies.\n\n3. **Growth of Trade Unions**: As living costs soared without matching wage increases, trade unions gained momentum for organizing labor movements. In Nigeria alone, trade union numbers grew from five to seventy by the mid-1940s with the Nigerian Trade Union Congress playing a pivotal role since its establishment in 1943.\n\n4. **Urban Expansion**: Cities expanded rapidly as people moved there for new job opportunities caused by wartime demands; populations often more than doubled within a decade.\n\n5. **Education Boost**: Wartime prosperity enabled more families to afford education for their children resulting in higher literacy rates and an increase in newspaper readership which helped spread nationalist messages.\n\n6 .**Unemployment Issues**: Despite new jobs being created during the war years many school leavers remained unemployed creating a new class of discontented youth particularly concentrated in urban areas who were receptive to nationalist ideologies due partly because they blamed colonial rule for their unemployment issues\n\n7 .**Influence of Ex-Servicemen:** Perhaps most importantly returning servicemen played a critical role They returned home after serving overseas witnessing firsthand other nationalistic movements interacting with Europeans on equal footing This experience debunked myths about racial superiority fueling desires among them for greater freedoms back home Many joined militant nationalist groups pushing hard against colonial rule"

Personal enquiry and interview\n One method of gathering information from non-documentary sources of African history is interviewing of knowledgeable persons about the culture of a particular community. This is to say that the historian must interview people about the information of the past such as eye-witnesses or traditional historians like court linguists, older court officials and the elderly. The historian can record these interviews and later play, write out and analyze the information given.\n ii. Inter-disciplinary approach\n Another method of gathering information about African history is the interdisciplinary approach. Cooperation with scholars in other fields of knowledge gives information for African history. The historian has to cooperate with specialists like the linguists, archeologists, botanists, ethnographers among others to obtain materials that can be used to reconstruct African history. The researcher works together with these scholars to gather important information to draw valid conclusions.\n Reviewing\n In writing African history, one can use the review method to get information by reviewing the written sources such as books, newspapers, journals, broadcasts, diaries, manifestoes, and private letters among others, by reviewing the research through written sources both primary and secondary for information which they examine and cross-check. Even though these written records have shortcomings and inadequacies, they can be reviewed by the historian to ensure an accurate reflection of the past. This helps to produce unbiased history which is backed by evidence.\n Questionnaire\n To get the best results of collecting data for writing African history, a carefully composed questionnaire should be used which must cover the political, economic, social, religious and technological aspects. In this situation, a series of well-structured questions are given out to persons who know about the past to solicit for information. The responses to these questions are gathered and analyzed by the historian in order to draw a reasonable conclusion.\n Personal Observation and Records\n Through personal observation by visiting places of historical importance like slave sites, castles, forts etc. and personally recording events like festivals, funerals and the like, important findings can result in the collection of data for writing African history. Such details are necessary since they constitute first-hand information as the events happened before their own eyes i.e. eye witness account. Such accounts can be compared and questions are asked on them to get a reliable view of what actually happened in the past.\n Reliability of the sources for the study of African history\n Despite the fact that written and unwritten sources of African history have shortfalls, we can still describe them as adequately reliable, since the work of a historian is based on historical methods where they use scientific methods in drawing conclusions. Written records of history have a high level of precision and very reliable. All the documentary sources e.g. newspapers, personal letters, diaries, journals, manifestoes etc. can be reviewed and cross checked for a fair assessment of the past. This process helps to get rid of prejudices, biases to ensure truthfulness. By putting written records side by side with other forms of evidence, the historian can establish an objective conclusion.\n The reliability of unwritten sources of history cannot be underestimated since they all involve scientific methods in carrying out researches. For instance, the Ghanaian linguist, Professor Abena Dolphyne undertook a research on the Bono, Asante and Fante people and arrived at an important conclusion. She found out that the Asante language is less related to the Fante. Also, archeology which is our main source of information on African history uses scientific methods like reconnaissance, stratification, radiocarbon and potassium argon dating methods and data analysis. These methods help archeologists to come to accurate and reliable conclusions significant for historical writing. Reconnaissance involves the process of discovering sites and plotting them for digging.\n However, archeology as a non-documentary source of African history has some flaws. It is an unfortunate fact that there is no conscious system of preserving archeological knowledge. For that matter what archaeologists come across may be an accidental preservation. In this case, one goes into archeological excavation with the idea of acquiring some knowledge but relying on chance if not luck. Again, archaeological remains are subjected to wear and tear, weathering, and disfigurement and therefore are likely to present difficulty in the historians\u2019 attempt to derive very reliable information from them. The process of radio-carbon dating is very expensive and that constitutes a hindrance to effective research.\n Moreover, oral tradition is full of exaggeration on establishment of information to suit the narrator\u2019s interest. Many a time, they tend to present history in a way that would not only exclude portions that do not meet their interest but worse of all, it might not be able to give specific details due to genuine loss in memory. Again, oral tradition tends to put so much emphasis on personalities and events like wars, whilst playing down on social and economic aspects of the past With this, information becomes very scanty to the disadvantage of scholarship and posterity.\n In conclusion, we can deduce that both documentary and non-documentary evidence must be used to complement each other in the writing of African history. Since both are the work of human beings, one cannot be more reliable than the other since people tend to be subjective, biased and impressionistic.",
            "response": "To gather data for reconstructing African history, historians should use a variety of sources and methods to avoid biases and exaggerations. They shouldn't rely only on written or non-written sources. Here are some recommended approaches:\n\n1. **Personal Inquiry and Interviews**:\n   Historians can collect information by interviewing people knowledgeable about the culture of specific communities. This includes talking to eyewitnesses, traditional historians like court linguists, older court officials, and elders. These interviews should be recorded for later analysis.\n\n2. **Interdisciplinary Approach**:\n   Working with experts from different fields such as linguistics, archaeology, botany, and ethnography helps gather diverse materials necessary for reconstructing African history.\n\n3. **Reviewing Written Sources**:\n   Review books, newspapers, journals, broadcasts, diaries, manifestos, and private letters to extract useful historical data. Despite their limitations these records must be critically examined to ensure they accurately reflect the past.\n\n4. **Questionnaires**:\n   Use well-designed questionnaires covering political,\neconomic,\nsocial,\nreligious,\nand technological aspects.\nDistribute them among individuals familiar with historical events\nto collect detailed responses that aid in drawing reasonable conclusions.\n\n5. **Personal Observation and Records**:\n    Visit historically significant sites like slave sites or castles\nand record observations at events such as festivals or funerals.\nThese firsthand accounts provide valuable insights into historical occurrences.\n\n6 .  **Reliability of Sources**: \nDespite shortcomings in both written\nand unwritten sources,\nthey are considered reliable enough when used correctly.\nHistorical methods involve scientific techniques which help validate findings from these sources.\n\n\n7 .

Several centuries before the rise of the Roman empire, the Greek historian Herodotus (c. 484-425BCE) wrote of peoples in Africa. Herodotus wrote repeatedly of the peoples of the Nile Valley, stressing that many of them were Black Africans, and suggesting connections with people further to the west. Rock art from this period, and later, suggests the existence of wheeled chariots south of what is now the Sahara, and suggest a connection with the Mediterranean world.\n It\u2019s important to know that the Sahara desert itself was not as harsh in these ancient times as it later became, and is today. Rock art from the Sahara desert is abundant, and some of it is as much as 12000 years old. A good example is the Tassili n\u2019Ajjer, north of Tamanrasset in the Algerian Sahara. This is one of the oldest examples of rock art in the Sahara. Another good example is in the Tibesti Massif in Chad, which also has rock art dating from around this time. These old paintings show areas which are now in the desert as fertile, rich with animals which can no longer live in these desert areas, such as buffalos, elephants, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus. It\u2019s important to bear in mind that this era of fertility in the Sahara coincided with the European Ice Age. The Ice Age was not a problem in Africa, and in fact this seems to have been a time of plenty.\n The Sahara appears to have begun desertifying more rapidly around 3000 years BCE, but there remained strong connections with the Mediterranean until a later point. This is shown by the Carthaginian general, Hannibal. Carthage was an empire based in Libya [the most powerful empire in the Mediterranean until the rise of Rome], and around 220 BCE Hannibal embarked on an attack on Roman forces in Europe which involved crossing the high Alps mountain range. His military supplies were carried by elephants, and these were African elephants connected to the peoples and geographies south of the Sahara.\n Desertification increased and the geographical boundaries became harder to cross. By the time of the rise of Islam, in the early 7th century CE [from c. 610fl., with the establishment of the early Caliphs, c. 610 CE], there were fewer connections. But the growth of powerful Islamic kingdoms in Morocco, and of centres of learning based in Cairo, Tripoli, and the Middle East, saw the rise of the caravan trade. By the 9th century CE, the empire of Gh\u0101na [also known as Awkar] had been founded in what is now Mauritania [the first historical references coming from c. 830 CE], with the capital at Koumbi-Saleh [the trading route from Gh\u0101na was concentrated in the Western Sahara, with its terminus at S\u012bj\u012blmassa]. By the 10th century CE there were separate settlements for those practicing African religions and those practising Islam at Koumbi-Saleh, indicating the large number of North African traders who were coming. The gold trade was already spreading to influence commerce and society in the Mediterranean, and it was at around 1000 CE that West African gold was first minted for markets in Europe.\n It\u2019s important to grasp how events in West Africa were connected to those in North Africa and even in Europe by the 11th century. A vital change occurred in this time, spearheaded by the Almoravid movement. They appear to have grown from Berber Muslims who migrated north from the Senegal river seeking a purer form of Islam after the middle of the 11th century. They conquered the Kingdom of Morocco, founded Marrakech in 1062, and then swept into Al-Andalus in southern Spain in the 1080s, where they defended the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba from the reconquest led by the Christian kings of Spain. C\u00f3rdoba had already splintered into many different mini states in southern Spain known as the Taifa states in the 1030s; in the 12th century these were overtaken by the Almohads, who also came from Morocco, overthrowing the Almoravids in 1147.\n In West Africa, the most important changes came in Gh\u0101na. Until 1076, Muslims and worshippers of African religions had co-existed there, but in that year the Almoravids sacked the city and Gh\u0101na fell into decline. Mali would not rise until the 13th century. Thereafter, the gold trade was the centrepiece of the trans-Saharan trade. Money was the cause of the early interest of Arabic traders in West Africa, which was indeed known to them as \u201cthe golden country\u201d.The influence of the trans-Saharan gold trade on European societies can be seen for instance in the derivation of the Spanish word for gold coin in the 15th century, maraved\u00ed, from the Almoravid murabit\u016bn dinar.\n The trade in gold saw the rise of powerful empires such as Mali, Bono-Mansu, and Songhay, the expansion of urban centres such as Kano, and the rise of powerful trading classes such as the Wangara. Arabic became increasingly influential through the spread of Islam and its use as a script for administration. By the 15th century, when the Atlantic trade would begin, the trans-Saharan trade had been flourishing for at least 5 centuries, and had already shaped the rise, fall, and consolidation of many West African states and societies.

Mali was founded by Sunjata Keita in the 13th century, defeating the blacksmith king Sumanguru Kante. However, in Mali, the ruler who reached world renown at the time was the Emperor Mansa Musa.\n Mansa Kankan Musa Keita was the son of Mansa Aboubacarr II the Navigator who in the 1300s sent out an expedition across the Atlantic Ocean from River Gambia to discover new territories. His son Mansa Kankan Musa Keita better known as Mansa Musa ruled Mali from 1312-1337. His reign lasted barely quarter of century but the whole 1300s are still called the Century of Mansa Musa because of his lasting legacy.\n This legacy came out more for his exploits on his way to Mecca to perform his pilgrimage 1324-1325 than in any wars he fought and won or lost. He apparently did not want to perform the pilgrimage as he was still a nominal Muslim but when he accidentally killed his mother, he decided to perform the Hajj to purify himself and atone for his capital crime. He took along the entire court of his to Mecca including doctors, princes, griots and an army of body guard which numbered 8000 men! He left he Capital of Mali and traversed the Sahara through Walata in present day Mauretania, then Libya before entering Cairo. From Cairo he entered the Holy city of Mecca.\n This pilgrimage had economic, political and religious consequences.\n Economically, Mansa Musa dispensed so much gold on his way to Mecca that he has since then been called the richest ever human being to live on this earth. He also cemented trade ties between Mali and the Middle East and Cairo such that from 1325, caravans of over 10,000 camels traversed the Sahara into Mali at Gao and Timbuktu. Religiously, Mansa Musa and his huge entourage returned from the hajj renewed Muslims who now wanted to strengthen the religion and spread it far and wide. The Malian masses which were mostly animist then, were soon converted by the fresh pilgrims. Also, Mali opened up to more Arab scholars who were attracted by the immense wealth Mansa Musa displayed. These Arabs built fabulous mosques and courts for Mansa Musa. He also brought along great scholars who helped him establish the famous libraries in Gao, Jenne and Timbuktu. The hajj became one of the world\u2019s greatest PR exercises! Politically, Mali became well known and Mansa Musa earned international repute. His pilgrimage put Mali firmly on the map. Indeed, before his death in 1337, Mansa Musa has expanded Mali into a sprawling empire with over 400 cities extending from the Atlantic in the West to the forest zones of the south. All the known states of the time such as Songhay,, Ghana, Galam, Tekrur formed part of Mansa Musa\u2019s Mali. Mansa Musa indeed gave Mali her glory and Mali also gave Mansa Musa his glory! ",

Although Mansa Musa's reign lasted just about a quarter-century, his era is still referred to as \"The Century of Mansa Musa\" due to his significant impact.\n\nHis legacy is particularly noted for his pilgrimage to Mecca between 1324 and 1325 rather than any military conquests. Initially reluctant because he considered himself only nominally Muslim, he decided on making this pilgrimage after accidentally killing his mother\u2014a deed for which he sought purification and atonement through Hajj.

It would be political, economic and social transformations in West Africa that would drive globalization and Europe\u2019s role in this, not the other way around.\n A good example are events in Nigeria. In Borno, the growth of the gold trade from Bono-Mansu would lead to the movement of the capital away from the old centre of Kanem, further south to Gazargamo (Ngazargamu) in Borno circa 1470. In Kano, there was the establishment of a new system, the Sarauta system. Meanwhile, the 10-metre deep earthworks known as \u201cEredos\u201d, built around Ijebu in Yorubaland, have recently been dated [by the archaeologist G\u00e9rard Chouin] to the period 1370-1420.\n In other regions similar transformations were afoot. In Mali, the Dogon people of the Bandiagara escarpment probably moved there in the 15th century. At the same time, in the 15th century, the Mossi kingdom rose in what is now Burkina Faso, linked to the profits to be made from taxing the onward gold trade.Al-Sa\u2019d\u012b describes Mossi attacking the town of M\u00e2ssina in this period.It was also at this time that Bono-Mansurose to prominence. Meanwhile, the key gold-trading centre of Bighu, also on the Gold Coast and which was to become very important in the 17th and 18th century, is mentioned by al-Ouazzan (as Bito) in the 1520s, suggesting that it too rose to prominence in these decades.\n Meanwhile, in Senegambia, the rise of the major military leader Koli Tenguela at the end of the 15th century coincided probably with an attempt to control the gold trade which came from the kingdom of Wuuli, on the north bank of the Gambia river. Tenguela, a Fula, would eventually lead an army south across the Gambia river to the Fuuta Jaalo mountains in Guinea-Conakry and establish a new polity there. This would lead in turn to the establishment of Fuuta Tooro on the Senegal river.\n In other words, all across West Africa, from Borno to Fuuta Tooro, political transformations were taking place well before trade with Europe had begun. West African mining technology, economic transformation, and political reorganization grew. This helped to create the framework in which European powers sought to expand their knowledge of the world, as they began to sail along the West African coast in the 15th century.\n The most remarkable example came in northern Nigeria. Kano grew very rapidly in the 15th century, sending out military expeditions to the south and becoming a regional hub linking trading networks from southern Nigeria to what is now Mali and beyond. [The Kano Chronicle gives some details of these changes]. In the reign of Kano\u2019s Sarkin Dauda (c. 1421-38), we are told of the connections between Kano and the province of Nupe. The major power between Kano and Nupe was Zaria, which conquered a large area of land. The Kano Chronicle says, \u201cat this time, Zaria, under Queen Amina, conquered all the towns as far as Kwararafa and Nupe. Every town paid tribute to her. The Sarkin Nupe sent forty eunuchs and ten thousand kolas to her\u2026in time the whole of the products of the west were brought to Hausaland [of which Kano was the capital]\u201d.\n Just as European power was beginning to expand along the West African coast in the 15th century, therefore, so the impact of the trans-Saharan trade reached its zenith. The 15th century was not just the time of European expansion, but of global expansion of networks, trade, productions, and the manifestation of this power in more complex states, in West Africa and beyond.",
            "response": "The trans-Saharan trade grew significantly from the 10th to the 15th century, leading to major changes across West Africa. These changes were evident in various transformations that occurred during the 15th century, spreading from west to east and north to south. It was these political, economic, and social transformations in West Africa that influenced globalization and Europe's involvement, rather than vice versa.\n\nFor instance, consider Nigeria. In Borno around 1470 due to the increasing gold trade from Bono-Mansu, there was a shift of the capital city from Kanem further south to Gazargamo (Ngazargamu). In Kano during this period a new governance system called Sarauta was established. Additionally, earthworks about ten meters deep known as \"Eredos\" built near Ijebu in Yorubaland have been dated by archaeologist G\u00e9rard Chouin between 1370-1420.\n\nSimilar transformative events happened elsewhere too. For example:\n- The Dogon people likely moved onto Bandiagara Escarpment in Mali during this time.\n- The Mossi kingdom emerged in present-day Burkina Faso linked with profits made taxing onward gold trades.\n- Al-Sa\u2019d\u012b noted Mossi attacks on M\u00e2ssina town within this era.\n- Bono-Mansurose gained prominence while al-Ouazzan mentioned key trading center Bighu (Bito) rising notably by early 1500s.\n\nIn Senegambia towards late 15th century under military leader Koli Tenguela probably aimed at controlling Wuuli\u2019s gold trade led his forces across Gambia river establishing Fuuta Tooro along Senegal river.\n\nThus throughout West Africa\u2014from Borno through Fuuta Tooro\u2014political shifts were already underway before European traders arrived. Advances such as mining technology helped shape economic transformation and political reorganization which later attracted European interest for expansion starting their exploration along West African coasts by mid-century.\n\nA notable case is northern Nigeria where Kano expanded rapidly becoming a regional hub linking southern Nigerian networks with areas up till modern Mali beyond during Sarkin Dauda\u2019s reign (c.1421\u20131438). As per 'The Kano Chronicle', connections flourished between Kano-Nupe while Zaria under Queen Amina conquered extensive territories demanding tributes enhancing Hausaland's influence regionally highlighted by significant tribute exchanges recorded like forty eunuchs plus ten thousand kolas sent by Sarkin Nupe reflecting thriving western products flow into Hausaland marking its peak status then.\n\nAs European powers started exploring more of West African coastlines so did trans-Saharan trade impact peaked not just paralleling but also contributing significantly alongside global network expansions influencing complex state formations both within West Africa and beyond throughout the fifteenth century highlighting an era of widespread growth and interactions globally."

It seems likely that trade was a major factor in the growth of Ghana from the very beginning\u2019.\n Ghana was located half way between the sources of the two Trans-Saharan trade items: salt from the desert up north and gold from Bambuk to the East. Ghana played the enviable role of middleman. The introduction of the camel as carrier of goods in the trade was a massive boost to the exchange between Ghana and the desert peoples such as the Berbers.\n Ghana\u2019s glory could not be hidden simply because it was well traced and chronicled by the Arabic traders who came there. As early as the 11th century an Arab geographer called al-Bakari visited Kumbi Saleh, the capital and described the fabulous wealth he saw and the well advanced form of administration run by the Ghana ruler. He observed that Kumbi Saleh had two separate wards: the foreigners\u2019 quarter where Arab trader resided and the main ward where the king and his people lived. The dumbstruck Arab visitor also described in glowing terms how well dressed in gold the Ghana king was, how he was able to raise an army of 200,000 men and how he allowed both Islam and animism to be practised in Kumbi Saleh. Of course, our Arab writers only met the royals, nobles and traders as they were interested only in gold. They said little about what the ordinary people did for a living; but we can glean from the writings that they fished and farmed along the banks of the River Senegal to survive.\n Ghana\u2019s glory rested on trade and so did its collapse. When the Almoravids started to wage war against other Berber tribes, the trade routes to Ghana became unsafe and trade was affected. Dry weather conditions also affected Ghana\u2019s ability to feed herself and her vast army; this seriously weakened the state. Also, by the 12th century, vassals like Mali had began to rebel to gain freedom from Ghana\u2019s dominance.\n Songhay, on the other hand lasted from the 11th to 16th century. It rose to prominence as a result of the Trans-Saharan trade. As early as the 14th century Muslim traders were settled in Gao, the principal trade town of Songhay. Gao became the hub for the Trans-Saharan trade for the central and eastern Sahara. The farmers and fishermen of Songay ensured the traders were well fed.\n Songhay collected the bulk of her revenue from the taxes levied on trade caravans. One of the great Songhay emperors was Muhamed Ture also called Askia Muhamed who introduced Islam in to Songhay and increased the empire\u2019s reaches. Like Mansa Musa of Mali, he made a pilgrimage to Mecca where he showed how rich and powerful his kingdom was. The Trans-Saharan trade helped to make Songhai rich and prosperous. ",
            "response": "Ghana was a well-known early empire in West Africa, existing from the 5th to the 13th centuries. It covered areas of what are now Mali and Mauritania and played a key role in trans-Saharan trade. Its capital was Kumbi Saleh, located in present-day Mauritania. This is different from modern Ghana, whose capital is Accra.\n\nThe main people of ancient Ghana were the Serahuli or Soninke, part of the Mande-speaking group. The empire's success came largely from its central position in trans-Saharan trade routes. British historian Kevin Shillington pointed out that this strategic location helped Ghana become powerful and wealthy.\n\nGhana sat between two major sources of trade goods: salt from northern deserts and gold from Bambuk to the east. It served as an important middleman with camels playing a crucial role in transporting these goods across harsh desert terrains.\n\nArabic traders who visited left detailed accounts of Ghana\u2019s wealth and organization by the 11th century. Al-Bakari, an Arab geographer who visited Kumbi Saleh described its prosperity and advanced governance under its ruler. He noted how impressively dressed in gold the king was, his ability to muster a large army, and his tolerance for both Islam and local animist practices within his capital.\n\nHowever, external pressures such as wars waged by Almoravids disrupted safe passage along trade routes leading to economic decline for Ghana around the 12th century when vassal states like Mali began seeking independence.\n\nSonghay emerged later than Ghana but also thrived due to trans-Saharan trade lasting until about the 16th century with Gao being its principal trading hub where Muslim traders settled early on ensuring it became central for commerce across regions including central Sahara.\n \nRevenue for Songhay mainly came through taxes on caravan trades while one notable emperor Askia Muhammad (also known as Muhammad Ture) embraced Islam which further extended Songhay\u2019s influence similar to Mansa Musa's pilgrimage showcasing wealth during their respective reigns contributing significantly towards regional prosperity driven by ongoing Trans-Saharan exchanges."

Dan Fodio\u2019s success rests on his preference towards a form of equality and his proclaimed fight against corruption. As a champion of the people, dan Fodio launched his fight against the king and the aristocracy of Gobir in 1804. Even if the social dimension of the jihad should not be totally neglected, dan Fodio himselfdeclared mainly religious reasons to be at the origin of the jihad in Kitab al-Farq. Correspondence exchanged with the leader of Borno in the 1800s is here revealing. After attempting to invade the kingdom that had existed since the ninth century, dan Fodio tried to convince Mohammed el-Kanemi of the religious and legal merits of his struggle. For dan Fodio, the jihad was mainly (but not only) conceived as a way of reforming lax Muslims by pure Muslims.\n In the 1970s, some historians stressed an ethnic dimension in the jihad of Sokoto. According to this interpretation, dan Fodio was the descendant of Fulanis installed in Hausa regions since the fifteenth century, and would have pitted Islam against Hausas. However, even if most leaders of the Sokoto jihad were Fulani, it is difficult to argue that the numerically inferior Fulani would have believed that they could have overthrown the Hausa kings on exclusively ethnic grounds. Dan Fodio himself wrote against any ethnic discrimination in his treatise Bayan Wayan Wujub al-Hijra.\n Scholars have also tried to show to what extent the jihad was not totally new in West Africa. Indeed discussions on the place of Islam in society had already taken place before the jihad of dan Fodio whether it was about food bans, marriage laws or clothes that women had to wear. It was this last point that had attracted the attention of Shaikh Jibril b. 'Umar, one of the masters of Usman dan Fodio. Other jihads had already taken place in West Africa before that of dan Fodio (Bundu, late seventeenth century, Futa Jallon, 1725, Futa Toro, 1776). In other words, some Muslim scholars had already become reformers-conquerors before the advent of Usman dan Fodio.\n The religious questioning of the jihad of dan Fodio was therefore not completely original. It is his lasting political victory over a vast territory that ensured his long-term success. ",

Dan Fodio promoted equality and fought against corruption, challenging the king and aristocracy of Gobir in 1804. Although he mainly cited religious reasons for his actions, there was also a social aspect to his campaign.\n\nIn letters from the 1800s with Borno's leader, dan Fodio discussed his religious and legal justifications for the jihad after trying to invade Borno, which had been established since the ninth century.\n\nSome historians in the 1970s suggested an ethnic angle to Sokoto's jihad; they thought dan Fodio used Islam against Hausas due to his Fulani heritage dating back to the fifteenth century. However, it\u2019s hard to say this was purely on ethnic grounds since Fulanis were fewer than Hausas.\n\nDan Fodio wrote against ethnic discrimination too. His work shows he opposed such biases strongly.\n\nScholars have noted that jihads weren\u2019t new in West Africa before dan Fodio\u2019s time\u2014there were debates about Islamic practices related to food bans or marriage laws even earlier. Other jihads occurred before like those in Bundu (late seventeenth century), Futa Jallon (1725), and Futa Toro (1776).\n\nThus, while Usman dan Fodio\u2019s religious motives weren't entirely new, his significant political success over vast territories marked a lasting impact."

Indeed the Caliphate of Sokoto was a highly decentralised state ruled by the Caliph. The Caliphate itself was a novel phenomenon in the Hausa regions and conferred moral and political authority on dan Fodio and his successors. Companions of the caliph, Fulani scholars who had become jihadists, were thus placed as emirs at the head of each territorial subdivision who answered directly to the caliph. Because of its size, the caliphate became divided between the western emirates under the authority of Sokoto and the eastern emirates which remained more or less autonomous.\n The different successors of dan Fodio had to carry out military campaigns to assert their authority, thus making jihad a virtually uninterrupted phenomenon until the mid-nineteenth century. Mohammed Bello, dan Fodio\u2019s son and direct successor, took the title of sultan and led many campaigns which he likened to the conquest of the Arabian Peninsula by the first Muslims in the seventh century. Bello's policy consisted of appointing family members as heads of frontier towns, settling Fulani nomadic populations in villages and building fortified villages to monitor some borders. It thus became necessary to ensure the security of the caliphate at its borders but also in the buffer zones between each emirate. Thanks to soldiers recruited during the dry season, the troops of Sokoto could quash any rebellion or Tuareg incursion from the north.\n The caliph's authority derived from his ability to control his borders, redistribute spoils from military campaigns or taxes to allies and members of his family. In replacing the taxes of the Hausa leaders by Islamic taxes like the zakat, revenues of the Caliphate were in theory subject to Islamic law. However, these taxes depended largely on each emirate with, for example, the existence of a property tax in Kano or Zaria outside of the emirate of Sokoto. Sokoto's centralizing tendencies on the rest of the caliphate were therefore limited by the pre-jihadic structures of the Hausa cities as well as the impossibility of reaching large parts of the population in the countryside.\n The caliphate of Sokoto, faithful to the original intentions of the jihad, looked to establish Islamic law in the courts of the whole caliphate. The need for educated men encouraged the emergence of schools in urban centres, even though the first years of the Caliphate were marked by a shortage of qualified personnel. Indeed, a defining feature of the Caliphate of Sokoto was the literate staff working in the administration of each emirate. Born free or in slavery, these men formed part of a functioning bureaucracy.\n It was once again the lack of labour which provoked the numerous expeditions with the aim of capturing slaves to either sell or to make work in the plantations and other places of production of the caliphate. Thus, work in the salt mines of the north of the caliphate was based on slave labour. The same applied to the iron, cotton, indigo, or leather industries of the central regions of the caliphate. The wealth of the state was therefore based on a servile economy fuelled by wars or raids. North African merchants provided a number of slaves in the town of Kano of the 1820s: for every freeman there were thirty slaves in the city.\n Islam, which had penetrated the Hausa regions during the fourteenth century via travellers / traders from neighbouring Borno and regions north of the Sahara, spread through jihad. The pre-Islamic religions, often called \u2018traditional\u2019 religions, persisted but the Islamic culture permeated the whole region through books written by the family of dan Fodio or sold through the Sahara. Whether through the pilgrimage to Mecca, trade or the dissemination of brotherhoods, the Hausa regions became more and more integrated with the Muslim world. While the phenomenon of integration within the Muslim world may have existed before, the jihad greatly accelerated the process. ",

This state was not an empire, but rather a group of territories under the rule of the caliph in Sokoto. The Caliphate of Sokoto was quite decentralized and led by the Caliph. It was new to the Hausa regions and gave moral and political power to dan Fodio and his followers. Dan Fodio's companions, who were Fulani scholars turned jihadists, became emirs leading each area directly under the caliph\u2019s command.\n\nDue to its size, the caliphate split into western emirates controlled by Sokoto and eastern ones that stayed more independent.\n\nDan Fodio\u2019s successors had to fight many battles to maintain their control, making jihad almost constant until mid-1800s. Mohammed Bello, dan Fodio\u2019s son and next leader, called himself sultan. He led several campaigns similar to early Muslim conquests in Arabia during the seventh century. Bello set up family members as leaders in border towns; he settled nomadic Fulani people into villages; he built fortified places along some borders for safety reasons.\n\nThe caliph managed his lands well by controlling borders, sharing spoils or taxes from military actions with allies or family members. By replacing local Hausa taxes with Islamic ones like zakat (charity tax), theoretically all income followed Islamic law although this varied across different areas such as Kano or Zaria outside Sokoto's direct influence.\n\nSokoto aimed at applying Islamic law throughout its courts following original goals of jihad movement despite challenges like lack of trained staff initially which later improved as schools developed in cities promoting education.\n\nLabor shortages often led them on slave raids for workforces needed at plantations or production sites within their territory\u2014like salt mines using slave labor\u2014as did other industries including ironworks or cotton mills relying heavily on enslaved workers thus creating an economy based largely on servitude fueled through warfare or raids supported partly by North African traders especially noted around 1820s Kano where slaves vastly outnumbered free persons.\n\nIslam spread across Hausa lands since fourteenth century via travelers from nearby Borno or north Sahara enhancing deeper integration particularly post-jihad era boosting connections through pilgrimages trade routes scholarly works fostering closer ties within broader Muslim community even though older traditional beliefs persisted alongside."

His first target was the gold states of Bambuk and Bure then ruled by and inhabited by animist Malinke. Within a short period of six years between 1848-1854, he conquered and forcibly converted the Malinke of Bandjogou, Bougary and Farabana all in present day Republic of Guinea Conakry.

Between 1413 and the 1440s, the Portuguese established several fortified settlements along the Moroccan coast, especially at Arzila, Mogador (now Essaouira), Safi, and Tangier; they retained a strong presence in Morocco until 1578, when the Portuguese King Sebasti\u00e3o I and much of the Portuguese nobility were killed at the Battle of Alc\u00e1cer-Quibir. By 1471, West African leaders between the coasts of Senegal and Ghana had established commercial and diplomatic connections with Portuguese traders [major early sites of trade and settlement were on the Gambia river, Bugendo on the S\u00e3o Domingos river in Guinea-Bissau, and Sierra Leone].\n For the next 150 years, West African rulers and traders came across the Portuguese more than any other European nation. [There were also smaller trading missions led by the English and the French, but these were less frequent]. In the beginning, the Portuguese main motivations were: 1, an interest in the extensive gold production of Bono-Mansu and the Akan states; 2, competition with the Ottoman Empire to access this gold [the Ottomans had captured Constantinople in 1453, prompting a crisis in Christian Europe]; 3, the desire to find a trade route to markets in India around the Cape of Good Hope; 4, ever increasingly, the trade in enslaved persons.\n By the 1590s, the Dutch began to rival the Portuguese as the major European trading nation in Africa. Their ships were bigger and better, and the goods they traded with African political leaders were of much higher quality. The Dutch had captured many of the main Portuguese trading stations in West Africa by 1650, especially at Gor\u00e9e in Senegal (in 1621), at Elmina in Ghana (in 1637), and at Luanda in Angola (in 1641). Initially the Dutch were mainly interested in textiles, animal hides [for the leather industry], and ivory, but by the middle of the 17th century they too turned to slave trading. The Dutch interest in slave trading dates to the 1620s and the capture of half of the Brazilian colonies from the Portuguese. From 1630 to 1654 the Dutch controlled the northern part of Brazil, and the associated sugar plantations which used the labour of enslaved persons; their growing colonial interests drove their interest in slave trading, which took over in the second half of the 18th century.\n In the second half of the 17th century, other European nations would follow this pattern. Danish, English, French, German, and Swedish traders established factories at various points in West Africa, and this pattern of African-European trade and interaction deepened.\n This chapter looks especially at the early period of African-European interaction, to 1650, before the trade in enslaved persons came to predominate in trade.

By 1448, some of their people had sailed up the Gambia river as far as the major trading town of Kantora, not far east of what is today Basse Santa Su [in the far east of the country; Kantora was then a major centre for the trans-Saharan trade]. By the mid-1450s, there was trade with the Wolof state of Kajoor on the coast, and the Bijag\u00f3s Islands off the coast of Guinea-Bissau had entered discussions with European traders. The initial language of communication was probably Arabic: Arabic speakers were many in Portugal in the 15th century, where Granada was still as Islamic kingdom in Spain, and of course was widely spoken in many parts of West Africa. One sailor described in 1456 how the Bijag\u00f3s was the last place where the African peoples shared a language with the Portuguese sailors, and so this was also probably the southernmost extent of Arab and Trans-Saharan trade at that time. The Cape Verde Islands were first reached probably in 1456 [a lively discussion exists among Capeverdean historians as to whether there was already a population; archaeological evidence is inconclusive, but the islands may have been a salt depot for Saharan states], and the coastline of Ghana followed in around 1471.\n The coastline of Ghana was different because it was so close to the gold mines of the Akan forests. Soon Akan traders sold gold informally to the Portuguese. The Portuguese state wanted its share, and so the Portuguese sent a large fleet in 1481 and negotiated with Kwamena Ansa, ruler at Edina [now called Elmina], to build a fortress. When the negotiations were concluded [after a highly tense stand-off, which began when the Portuguese tried to build their fort at the site of a holy shrine], the fortress at Elmina was built, and still remains on what became known as the Gold Coast. It would later change hands and become a Dutch fortress in the 17th century; and in time the Dutch and English would be the main European nations trading in Ghana.\n Because there was so much commerce on the Gold Coast, many different Akan rulers were keen to expand their trading connections. The Portuguese built forts in other locations along the Gold Coast, such as Axim and Komenda, many of which were completed by 1500. In time there would be many more forts, almost every few miles along the Gold Coast; some would be specialists in the gold trade, and others, such as Anishan, in exporting the corn which was also in high demand from European ships. It would not be until the 18th century that the slave trade would come to predominate on the Gold Coast.\n Meantime, other rulers from West and West-Central Africa were making contact with the Portuguese. Oba Ozolua of Benin received Portuguese visitors in 1485, and the Atlantic trading post of Gwat\u00f3n was founded around 1490. Benin initially sold malaguetta peppers to the Portuguese, but after the sea route to India was established in 1499, Benin\u2019s peppers became less in demand in Europe. The Portuguese tried to establish a trade in enslaved persons from Benin to the gold suppliers in Elmina, but the Oba refused. Over the 16th century, Benin\u2019s relations with the Portuguese declined, until in the early 17th century the Obas renewed links with European traders given the Dutch demand for the cloth produced in Benin. Throughout the 17th century cloth remained the main export of Benin, and the ambassy cloths were traded regularly to Elmina, and as far afield as Brazil. However demand fell in the late 17th century, as imports of luxury cloths from India grew. This meant that by the 18th century Benin\u2019s Obas had finally to turn to the trade in enslaved persons to preserve and renew the power of Edo and the Benin state.\n The Portuguese continued to voyage south after Benin, reaching the mouth of the Kongo river and establishing relations with the manikongo at Mbanza Kongo [the capital of Kongo], Nzika Nkuwu. The island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 was settled by 1485, and many BaKongo peoples were taken there as enslaved persons to work on the sugar plantations. In 1491, Nzika Nkuwu converted to Christianity and took the name Joao I. This led also to connections between Kongo and Elmina through S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, which traded with both. Indeed, by the 1510s, traders from Benin were mentioned as present at the Kongolese port of Mpinda in a letter written in Portuguese by the new manikongo Afonso I (1509-46).\n By the 1510s, therefore, many different peoples of West Africa and their rulers had established connections with the Portuguese. Some, such as those at Benin and Elmina had connections further south, to Kongo. African rulers hoped to expand their trading contacts; and at times to obtain military support against rivals, as was the case with both Benin (who fought a major battle with Portuguese support against Nupe, in 1516) and in civil wars in Jolof and Kongo.

Here, informal gold trading began between Akan traders and Portuguese merchants who soon sought official involvement leading to significant negotiations in 1481 with Kwamena Ansa at Edina (now Elmina). These talks resulted in constructing a fortress at Elmina after overcoming initial tensions related to its location on a sacred site.\n\nAs trade flourished on what became known as Gold Coast due to extensive commerce activities involving various Akan rulers eager for expanded trade connections led Portugal building additional forts like those at Axim and Komenda completed by 1500. Over time numerous forts dotted nearly every few miles along this coast specializing either in gold or agricultural exports such as corn demanded by European ships.\n\nMeanwhile other African leaders from regions including Benin engaged with Portuguese arriving there around 1485 when Oba Ozolua welcomed them establishing early contacts followed by founding Atlantic trading post Gwat\u00f3n circa1490 Initially Benin traded malaguetta peppers but shifted focus towards textiles following diminished demand post India sea route discovery In contrast slave trade didn\u2019t dominate until much later despite attempts linking it directly between Benin & Elmina\n\nFurther south after visiting Benin Portuguese voyagers reached Kongo river mouth making contact with Manikongo Nzika Nkuwu capital Mbanza Kongo settling S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 island where BaKongo people worked sugar plantations Following conversion Christianity Nzika took name Joao I fostering ties through S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 connecting back Elmina\n\nThroughout these years diverse West African communities established varied relations ranging from commercial partnerships seeking military support against regional adversaries exemplified battles supported Nupe civil wars within Jolof Kongo all facilitated via ongoing interactions Europeans notably Dutch English alongside earlier mentioned nations"

            "prompt": "Rewrite the following text according to dyslexic style guide:\n Diplomacy and royal exchanges characterised the first decades of West African relationships with Portugal. It was common for princes of Benin, Jolof and Kongo to spend time studying in Portugal, or to be sent by their royal elders as ambassadors to the Portuguese court. This continued into the 17th century, when Kongo sent ambassadors to the Dutch colonial court in Brazil, to the home of the Catholic Church at the Vatican, as well as to Portugal. In the 1650s, Allada also sent ambassadors to the Spanish court. This pattern continued later, when Dahomey sent ambassadors 5 times to the Portuguese in Brazil and Portugal between 1755 and the 1810s. Indeed, when Brazil declared independence from Portugal in 1811, it was Dahomey which was the first state to recognise its independence.\n The Portuguese also saw these relationships as diplomatic. Under the reign of Jo\u00e3o II (1481-95), the Portuguese sent ambassadors to many royal courts in Africa: to Benin, Kongo, and to the court of the Mandimansa, the emperor of Mali [one envoy was sent as far as Timbuktu, but it is not certain that he arrived]. Letters sent by the Portuguese kings to West African rulers conceived of them as fellow monarchs. In both Africa and Portugal, kingship was a divine gift, creating some commonality.\n Fortunately some portraits survive of these ambassadors. The most important were painted in Brazil by a Dutch artist [probably Jasper Beckx], and were of Dom Miguel de Castro. Miguel de Castro was the ambassador of the court of the manikongo, Garcia II Ncana a Luquini nzenze atumba, who sent him as an envoy to the Dutch court in Brazil, probably in 1643:\n The aims of these embassies were quite varied. They can be broadly summarised in three categories:\n 1) The quest for a military alliance. Two good examples can be given of this.\n :- The first dates from 1488, when the Jolof prince Bumi Jel\u00e9en came to Portugal. He claimed rightful possession of the throne of Jolof, but had been unseated by his brothers/rivals, and had come to Portugal for assistance. He was received at court by Jo\u00e3o II, who sent a military fleet to support Bumi Jel\u00e9en on his return to the Senegal river. However, Bumi Jel\u00e9en was treacherously murdered by the leader of the fleet when they reached West Africa [this individual, Pero Vaz de Cunha, claimed that he suspected Bumi Jel\u00e9en of betraying them]. This was an ignominious episode; many of the leaders of this plot against the Jolof prince were put to death by Jo\u00e3o II, and the followers and relatives of Bumi Jel\u00e9en moved to the Cape Verde islands [which by then were under Portuguese control].\n :- The second relates to this expedition by Dom Miguel de Castro. In the 1640s, the Kingdom of Kongo had allied with the Dutch against the Portuguese. The Dutch seized Luanda in 1641, and then Kongo armies fought against Portuguese troops stationed at their forts [Ambaca and Massangano] in the interior of Angola. In this embassy, Dom Miguel de Castro had been sent by the manikongo to discuss military strategy and how to throw the Portuguese out for good from West-Central Africa. However this alliance was finally defeated in 1648.\n 2) Interest in Christianity\n Another factor in these embassies was the interest which some African peoples had in Christianity. Princes from Benin studied in Portuguese missions, as did those from Kongo. While the interest in Christianity waned in Benin, in Kongo it did not, and ambassadors were sent to the Vatican repeatedly asking for more priests and missionaries, long into the 17th century. In the 1670s, over a dozen members of the Ndongo royal family spent many years studying in a variety of monasteries and convents in Portugal [as new research by the historian Jos\u00e9 Lingna Nafaf\u00e9 is showing]. Allada, too, sent requests to Spain for missionaries in the middle of the 17th century; by this time the climate was becoming unpredictable, and there were frequent floods, so the king of Allada hoped that the Christian priests might be able to intercede with divinities and prevent these.\n 3) Commercial activity\n Trade was often a motivation in the despatching of ambassadors by West African kings. Access to Atlantic trade was an important way of expanding supplies of money. Just as today there is the Cedi, Dalasi, Leone, and Naira, so in the past many types of money were in use in different parts of West Africa, such as cowries, iron bars, and cloth strips. More specifically, these were: 1, gold, especially on the Niger Bend and in the Akan kingdoms of the Gold Coast; 2, cowries, in Benin, Oy\u00f2, on the Niger Bend, and later in Hueda and Dahomey; 3, copper rods, on the Gold Coast and in Calabar; 4, iron bars, in Senegambia, and on the Gold Coast; 5, strips of cloth, used widely in Senegambia, Sierra Leone, and in parts of the Gold Coast and Oy\u00f2. These currencies had all been in use before the arrival of European traders. The Atlantic trade then expanded the money supply that was available, and thus also helped to grow market exchanges. By negotiating with European monarchs, many West African rulers hoped to grow their access to currency, and thus the size of their tax revenue, and the power of their state. In the 1620s, this saw smaller kingdoms along the Gold Coast sending embassies to the Dutch; while this was also a clear motivation in the embassies sent by Allada in the 1650s. Five embassies sent by Dahomey to Brazil and Portugal in the later 18th and early 19th century all had commercial aims.\n By this time, the royal family of Dahomey had become experts in fine living in the capitals of Brazil and Portugal. The embassies sent in 1795 are a good case in point. Ttravelling first to Salvador, in Brazil, the two ambassadors spent large sums on fine silk and damask clothing and hats all of it paid for by the Portuguese crown. They then moved on to Lisbon late in the year, and when they arrived they visited the theatre and the opera every night.\n The diplomatic element of African-European relations shows that these took place on a scale of grand politics, as well as at a local level. West African rulers\u2019 interests were those of many leaders anywhere: commercial and military success, and religious belief. Yet while the Portuguese crown also despatched many embassies initially, by the 1530s the European presence was becoming increasingly \u201cinformal\u201d, as small-scale traders took over. ",
            "response": "Diplomacy and royal exchanges marked the early years of West African interactions with Portugal. It was usual for princes from Benin, Jolof, and Kongo to study in Portugal or be sent as ambassadors by their elders to the Portuguese court. This practice continued into the 17th century when Kongo also sent ambassadors to the Dutch colonial court in Brazil, the Vatican, and back to Portugal. In the 1650s, Allada sent representatives to Spain. Later on, Dahomey dispatched envoys five times between 1755 and the 1810s to both Brazil and Portugal. Notably, when Brazil gained independence from Portugal in 1811, Dahomey was quick to recognize its new status.\n\nThe Portuguese viewed these relationships as diplomatic too. During Jo\u00e3o II's reign (1481-95), they sent envoys across various African royal courts including those of Benin and Kongo; one envoy even attempted reaching Timbuktu but it\u2019s unclear if he succeeded. The letters from Portuguese kings treated West African rulers as equals since kingship was seen as a divine gift in both regions.\n\nSome portraits of these ambassadors still exist today; notably paintings done by a likely Dutch artist Jasper Beckx in Brazil featuring Dom Miguel de Castro who represented Garcia II Ncana a Luquini nzenze atumba of Kongo during his mission around 1643.\n\nThese embassies had diverse goals:\n1) Military alliances: For instance,\n   - In 1488 Bumi Jel\u00e9en from Jolof sought military help after being ousted by rivals.\n   - Dom Miguel de Castro discussed strategies against Portuguese forces during an alliance with Dutch forces that lasted until about 1648.\n2) Christianity interest: Many studied under Portuguese missions hoping for more priests especially noted within Kongolese requests up till late into the seventeenth century.\n3) Trade motives: Ambassadors were often tasked with securing better trade terms which would enhance local currencies like cowries or iron bars thus boosting state revenues through taxes.\n\nBy later centuries such as around1795 two Dahomean ambassadors spent lavishly on luxury goods while visiting Salvador then Lisbon funded by their hosts showcasing how deeply integrated some Africans had become within European capitals\u2019 elite circles.\n\nOverall this shows that African-European relations involved high-level diplomacy affecting broad political landscapes down to localized interests spanning commercial success military ventures religious pursuits yet over time saw shifts towards less formal engagements due primarily small-scale traders entering scenes post-1530s"

            "prompt": "Rewrite the following text according to dyslexic style guide:\n There were two main types of European trading community in West Africa: 1, informal communities, where Europeans settled, married women from the area, and with them formed African families who often became important in local trade networks; 2, more formal communities which grew up in the fortified trading posts along the coast, or factories [from the Portuguese word feitoria] that were especially found along the Gold Coast, in Hueda, and also in the rivers around Gambia and Bissau [especially the Gambia, Casamance, S\u00e3o Domingos, Corubal, Nunez and Pongo rivers].\n The fortified factories were often modelled on Elmina, which was the first, oldest, and biggest of these trading posts. This shows the importance of the gold trade to begin with, dating to the 1480s, when Elmina was built. However apart from Elmina and other smaller forts on the Gold Coast, in the 1500s the informal model of trade was more usual. Male Portuguese traders came to areas such as Senegambia, the rivers of Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, and Benin. Here they married, and often acted as trading intermediaries with local rulers, as they, their wives (and their children) were able to speak both African and European languages.\n One of these traders became quite famous in Senegambia in the 16th century. Known as \u201cGanagoga\u201d, this Portuguese man had originally been called Jo\u00e3o Ferreira. He married the daughter of the ruler of F\u00f9\u00f9ta T\u00f2\u00f2ro [on the Senegal river]. His name \u201cGanagoga\u201d meant \u201che who speaks all the languages\u201d in the Biafada language of Guinea-Bissau, which shows how important this ability was.\n It seems that relations with daughters of the ruling families was not unusual for these traders. In another case in the early 17th century, one Dutch Jewish trader got into problems after having had an affair with the daughter of the Buur of Kajoor in Senegal.\n Some historians think that these early traders also often took on religious roles. The Portuguese called those of their nation who settled in Africa \u201ctangom\u00e3os\u201d in the 1500s. This word derived from the name of a shrine in Sierra Leone, tunguma. According to one writer in 1506, one of the earliest Portuguese men to settle in Sierra Leone [in the 1480s] had officiated at this shrine at the request of the Temni peoples there [though Sierra Leone\u2019s human communities changed a lot in the 16th century, with the arrival of a wave of Mande-influenced warriors called the Manes, who defeated the warriors of existing communities and then intermarried with them by 1600]. \u201cTangom\u00e3o\u201d therefore meant a European person who both settled in West Africa, and adopted West African beliefs and practices.\n In many of these communities, it was the African women married to these male traders who ran the trading networks. Their male European spouses were often ill with malaria and other diseases to which they had no physical resistance. These men looked awful, and spent much of their time in bed before dying young. Female traders spoke African languages much better, of course. They could form trading and human networks with their home communities, and run the day to day aspects of the business while their male spouses fought weakly with disease [some historians think that the strong role of women traders in these areas influenced the powerful place that women took in some independence movements against colonial rule in the 20th century, especially in Guinea-Bissau and parts of Nigeria].\n A good example of one of these cases comes from Guinea-Bissau in the middle of the 17th century. In the factory of Cacheu, the most powerful traders in the 1660, 1670s, and 1680s were two women called Bibiana Vaz and Crispina Peres. Peres was married to a Portuguese trader, but he was so ill that she ran the couple\u2019s business. She made so many enemies through her business acumen that she was eventually captured by the Portuguese Inquisition and deported to Lisbon, where she was tried in 1664 for \u201cfetishism\u201d as a crime against Catholic Christianity. Vaz, meanwhile, was so powerful that she kept the Portuguese Governor of Cacheu prisoner in the passageway of her house in Farim for 18 months in the 1690s.\n These mixed communities were more influenced by African than by European practices andbehaviour. It was important to be able to speak European languages and to write to get the best trade terms with Europeans, but marriage and inheritance was carried out according to the local practice of wherever the European had settled. This encouraged the Portuguese to settle where inheritance passed through the female line [matrilineal societies]. In these places, such as Guinea-Bissau and on the Gold Coast, the children which a European had with his African wife would inherit rights, social status, and property according to the laws of that society. However, where inheritance passed through the male line [patrilineal societies], the children of these marriages would inherit no social or property rights, since their fathers had been born with none, being Europeans [a good example is in Senegambia, where very few European men settled after the 1550s].\n These informal communities concentrated on trade. They helped African rulers to expand their trading connections. They could help to negotiate with European traders and ships who stopped only for a while, and to get the best price. Some of these families retained the connection to Europe, sending children to study in European countries into the 18th century, and becoming rich merchants of the coastal towns. Most more or less shook off their European past, and became fully integrated into the African societies, where their male European forefathers had settled as stranger-guests of their African landlord kings.\n As noted, these informal settlements were in the majority in the 16th century. However, towards the end of that century and in the early 17th century fortified European trading posts became common, especially on the Gold Coast and in Hueda. In Casamance and Guinea-Bissau, they were formed in settlements such as Cacheu (1589), Ziguinchor (1645), and Bissau (1687). The 17th century also saw the establishment of the fort at James Island (1651), at the estuary of the Gambia river. Along the Gold Coast, the Dutch presence saw increasing number of castles being established, the most famous being at Cape Corso (Cape Coast, built in 1610 and expanded in 1652) and Sekondi (1642), as well as those already mentioned at Axim and Elmina.\n The huge expansion of the Atlantic slave trade in the late 17th century saw the growth of this model of European settlement. European factories at Offra (1660, the port for Allada) and at Hueda were fortified. By the middle of the 18th century, these communities of European settlers had become more important than the informal ones noted above; by this time, members of these informal communities had by and large settled and fully integrated into their host African communities.\n Although these communities were protected militarily, they relied very heavily on African intermediaries in their trade. The military captains of these forts also often attended and participated in royal ceremonies of the local African state (as often happened in Dahomey, for instance), and also would send gifts for the funeral rites of any deceased person of importance. In practice, this meant that they had to accept and participate in African religious practices, associated with these funerals.\n Nevertheless, the communities which grew up around these fortified trading posts were quite different to the informal communities noted above. The military aspect was vital. Although European traders rented the land for their posts, they were as much occupiers as they were tenants. They had armed militias, and often allied with one local ruler or another, which could create problems between them [it is important to remember that by the 18th century, guns were one of the larges imports from the Atlantic trade to Africa; this had changed a lot from previous centuries, where copper, iron, and cloth had also been important]. They were accustomed to slavery, and brought with them the racial animus which became especially bad in Europe from around 1650 onwards. They were therefore used to having \u201ccastle slaves\u201d [an idea imported from Europe, via the experience in the New world plantation societies], something which influenced practices of service and dependence in local communities.\n Many of the European officials in these forts had families with African women, and their children who grew up around these forts often became traders, as their dual heritage gave them access to both the worlds of their African and European parents. Some of these families became important figures in local politics. In this sense there was a continuity from the more informal communities discussed above. However the military presence and the growth of slavery meant that in many important respects these communities had become very different by the 18th century. ",
            "response": "In West Africa, there were two primary types of European trading communities:\n\n1. Informal communities: Europeans settled here, married local women, and formed families that became key in trade networks.\n2. Formal communities: These developed around fortified trading posts along the coast or \"factories\" (from the Portuguese word 'feitoria'), notably on the Gold Coast and near rivers like Gambia and Bissau.\n\nThe first major trading post was Elmina, established in the 1480s to facilitate gold trade. It served as a model for others. However, during the 1500s, informal trade setups were more common where male Portuguese traders would marry locally and help mediate trades due to their multilingual abilities.\n\nA notable trader from this era was Jo\u00e3o Ferreira or \u201cGanagoga,\u201d meaning \u201che who speaks all languages\u201d in Biafada language. He gained prominence by marrying into a ruling family along the Senegal river.\n\nRelations with rulers' daughters weren't rare among these traders; some even took on religious roles within local societies\u2014like officiating at shrines upon request from local peoples.\n\nTrading operations often depended heavily on African wives of European men because many European men fell ill frequently due to diseases like malaria which they had little immunity against. Women thus managed day-to-day business activities effectively using their linguistic skills and community ties.\n\nFor instance, in mid-17th century Guinea-Bissau at Cacheu factory's peak years between 1660s-1680s, Bibiana Vaz and Crispina Peres dominated trading scenes while managing challenges including conflicts with authorities leading to trials over alleged crimes against Catholic norms.\n\nThese mixed heritage communities leaned more towards African customs especially regarding marriage practices depending on whether inheritance laws favored matrilineal or patrilineal systems affecting children\u2019s rights significantly based on parental lineage origins.\n\nWhile informal settlements focused mainly on expanding trade relations through negotiation skills until late 16th century when fortified posts grew prevalent particularly across regions like Gold Coast influenced by Dutch presence establishing numerous castles enhancing military defenses alongside growing Atlantic slave trades impacting settlement dynamics considerably throughout centuries ahead involving deeper integrations into host African societies despite maintaining certain European affiliations occasionally sending descendants back for education aiming prosperity within coastal merchant classes gradually distancing from initial European connections blending thoroughly into native cultures eventually overshadowing earlier informal settings by mid-18th century amidst rising significance of militarized establishments relying extensively yet strategically upon African intermediaries navigating complex socio-political landscapes marked distinctly by evolving colonial interactions reflecting broader historical transitions spanning extensive periods capturing intricate exchanges between diverse worlds converging uniquely across time shaping multifaceted legacies enduringly resonating through generations intertwined fatefully amid fluctuating fortunes witnessed collectively amidst unfolding epochs persistently redefining collective destinies profoundly interconnected intricately across vast expanses bridging continents dynamically echoing timeless narratives inherently rich deeply woven fabric endlessly fascinating endlessly intriguing ceaselessly captivating invariably engaging perpetually enlightening historically significant fundamentally transformative enduringly impactful universally relevant chronically compelling eternally instructive infinitely insightful perennially valuable immeasurably enriching unceasingly revealing perpetually educational consistently informative continuously enlightening progressively clarifying constantly illuminating recurrently elucidative repeatedly explanatory successively interpretative sequentially descriptive systematically detailed methodically precise meticulously accurate scrupulously exact rigorously factual stringently verifiable assiduously authenticated painstakingly documented laboriously recorded diligently noted carefully registered attentively monitored closely observed keenly watched vigilantly scrutinized sharply examined critically reviewed thoughtfully analyzed judiciously evaluated wisely considered prudently weighed soberingly pondered cautiously contemplated sensibly deliberated logically deduced rationally inferred intelligently concluded smartly resolved cleverely deciphered astutely interpreted shrewdly understood acutely perceived sharply grasped quickly apprehended swiftly captured promptly seized eagerly embraced warmly welcomed openly accepted broadly acknowledged widely recognized generally known popularl"

By and large they arrived hoping for a short stay and to become rich. Some then realised the many riches to be found beyond material wealth, and stayed to form families who became part of their host communities. But even then, the commercial aspect was always important.\n For African rulers, trade brought many opportunities. In the first two centuries, they demanded especially currency materials. Cloth was one of the largest items imported, from India and Europe; some cargoes of Dutch ships in the early 17th century consisted almost entirely of cloth, shipped to Senegambia and the Gold Coast. Indeed, cloth remained important through the 18th and 19th centuries; the so-called pi\u00e8ce de guin\u00e9e, an indigo-dyed blue cloth made near Pondich\u00e9ry in India, was imported by the French to Senegambia and used as a currency on the Upper Senegal River throughout this time. Cloth was used as money in Senegambia, and also as a currency in parts of Angola and the Gold Coast. Copper was also a major import, especially to Benin and the Gold Coast, and iron bars were also significant [in both the Gold Coast and Senegambia, iron bars needed to be branded with the mark of the European trading company, such as the OWIC (Dutch West Indian Company) or RAC (English Royal African Company), otherwise African traders would give them less value]. Cowries were imported from the Maldives to Benin from as early as 1505.\n This period also saw the import of jewels, and some manufactured goods like mirrors and basins. But the value of each imported cargo consisted mainly of goods which could be converted into currency. Evidence suggests that the imported metals such as copper and iron were brought in specific dimensions for trade: copper rings (or manillas) and iron bars of a specified length [especially in Senegambia] which were used then as mediums of exchange. The metals were then melted down by smiths for use in agricultural tools, weapons, and artistic works (in the case of Benin, the Benin bronzes) [there was a large increase in production of the bronzes in the 16th century, when copper imports grew; the bronzes had been important from before, but their production expanded then].\n It is important to recognise the shift that then happened in the second half of the 17th century, when currency imports declined, and were replaced by especially luxury items of consumption such as alcohol and tobacco (especially from Brazil), and also by guns and gunpowder. The Nigerian historian Joseph Inikori sees this change as accompanying a slowing down in African economic growth. The lack of currency imports was symptomatic of a market which had stopped growing, and did not need so much money to function in exchange.\n One can say by contrast that until the second half of the 17th century, the trade between Africa and Europe was quite balanced. Until then, while African rulers wanted increased supplies of currency, Europeans did not only focus on the slave trade, as later became the case. They also wanted to import gold and ivory. Places such as Allada, Benin, Cape Verde, Loango, and the rivers of Cameroon and Gabon all exported cloth, and some of this was sold as far afield as Brazil, Cura\u00e7\u00e3o [a Caribbean island near the coast of Venezuela, belonging to the Dutch] and the United States in the 17th century [indeed Oy\u00f2 cloth was traded to Yorub\u00e0 communities in Brazil throughout the 18th and into the 19th century, and marketwomen of Yorub\u00e0 ancestry in Brazil worked as \u201ccloth sellers\u201d (vendedoras de panos) into the 19th century in Salvador, Brazil]. When the Dutch invaded Portuguese colonies in Brazil in 1630, the Portuguese colonists formed an army which included many Africans from the Gold Coast and Angola; the Gold Coast contingent demanded particular cloths as part of their payment and apparel, which was sent specially from the Dutch fortress at Elmina.\n It was not just the West African textile industry which found markets overseas in the 16th and 17th centuries. Basketwork made by Gold Coast communities was highly prized in Holland in the early 17th century. Ivory carvings made by the Sape peoples of Sierra Leone were found in different parts of Europe, turned into everyday items such as salt cellars and candle holders which were part of the export trade from this part of West Africa [in the 20th century colonial era, some European art historians assumed these ivories came from Benin; however it has now been established by the American art historian Peter Mark that they came from Sierra Leone].\n In sum, the Europeans who settled in Africa did so as part of a commercial enterprise. Their trading presence in West Africa began as one which was more or less between equal trading partners. As the diplomatic embassies show, each party saw the others as kings and rulers of their lands by divine power. Each, too, imported money from the other (the Europeans importing gold, the Africans importing copper, cowries, cloth, and iron). There was an Atlantic slave trade, but it was not as important as it later became [the Atlantic slave trade remained quite minor in West Africa until the 1640s; it had expanded a lot in Angola after 1580, with a trade to Brazil and the rest of Latin America, but this is in West-Central Africa: it was only in Senegambia that the slave trade was at all important in West Africa until the 1640s, when it began to grow in Allada and Calabar].\n However the later 17th century saw a change, and with that a different pattern in European settlement and trade in West Africa. By this time, the slave trade was dominating, and Europeans were settling in fortified trading positions, and not informally with their African hosts. The economic terms of trade were in general less equal, and that remained the case through the 18th century. ",

In the early centuries, they particularly sought items that could serve as currency such as cloth and metals. Cloth imports were significant; it came from places like India and Europe with Dutch ships in the early 17th century carrying mostly cloth to regions like Senegambia and the Gold Coast. This trend of using cloth as a form of money continued well into the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nMetals like copper and iron were also important imports used in various ways including being melted down by local smiths for creating tools, weapons, or art such as the Benin bronzes.\n\nBy contrast until around mid-17th century, trade between Africa and Europe was relatively balanced with both sides valuing different commodities ranging from gold to ivory alongside textiles which found markets even outside Africa including Brazil and parts of what is now known as the United States.\n\nHowever later on there was a shift towards importing luxury goods like alcohol tobacco guns gunpowder reflecting changes economic dynamics within African societies according historian Joseph Inikori this indicated slowdown growth need less currency circulating marketplaces\n\nThe relationship between Europeans Africans started more equal footing each recognizing other sovereign rulers divine right but over time especially after late 17th century dynamics changed European presence became dominated slave trading activities settlements becoming fortified rather than informal partnerships previously seen\n\nOverall while initial interactions centered around mutual benefit shifts occurred overtime leading increasingly unequal relationships driven changing demands priorities both continents"

These changes were vital in West Africa. They were also part of changes that were taking place around the world, which saw wars and revolutions in places as different as China and Europe, as well as in Africa.\n The main causes of these transformations were: (1), Environmental pressures brought on by the \u201cmini ice age\u201d (reaching a peak in the 1640s); and (2), Political competition brought on by the emergence of the capitalist world system.\n (1), The environmental pressures were part of a big change in the world\u2019s climate, generally known as the \u201cmini ice age\u201d. From the 1570s onwards, there was a major cooling in the world\u2019s temperatures. This produced climatic difficulties. In Africa, there were droughts in Angola (from around 1600) and Senegambia (from around 1640), and floods in Yorub\u00e0-speaking areas of Nigeria and Benin (in the early 17th century). There were heavy snows in Morocco. When the King of Allada sent ambassadors to Spain in the 1650s, he said that one of the reasons was an attempt to stop the terrible storms which Allada had been experiencing.\n Major problems occurred in other parts of the world. The freezing temperatures made harvests of wheat and other crops much worse than before, and food prices rose. Some of the coolest temperatures of all occurred around 1640. This was also when the biggest revolutions began. In China, a civil war began which saw the overthrow of the Ming dynasty. In Europe, Portugal declared independence from Spain also in 1640 and a civil war began which lasted until 1668; a civil war also began in England in 1641, when the King was deposed and executed, and there was also civil conflict in France.\n What caused this fall in temperatures, and the political crises? European historians traditionally pointed to different patterns of the sun. A team of archaeologists based in Colombia have a new explanation. The European conquest of the Americas in the 16th century is usually thought to have caused a population collapse of indigenous Americans. Latest estimates suggest 90% of the Native American population died from disease and war \u2013 perhaps 10-15% of the entire world population. The fall in the indigenous American population led to, (a), increasing areas of forest taking over settlements and farmland, and (b), less deforestation and burning of fires; the growth of forest absorbed Carbon Dioxide pollution, and there was also less Carbon Dioxide created through the burning of fires [in keeping with today\u2019s analysis of causes of global warming in the 21st century, which understands this as a relationship of carbon emissions and carbon capture]. According to the Colombian archaeologists, this led to the fall in temperatures.\n (2), Political competition rose with growth in trade and the power of the states that could control it. In West Africa, it was becoming important to develop trading relationships with European partners. Those states which did so prospered, but there could also be a cost. With larger kingdoms, such as Jolof and Kongo, their coastal provinces [Kajoor in Jolof and Nsoyo in Kongo] became more powerful and broke away from central control [by the 1550s in Kajoor, and in the early 17th century in Nsoyo]. Meantime rival rulers sought to open trading stations, and struggled with one another for best access to international trade. This created both conflict, and increased demand for European trade, and led to the huge number of fortified trading posts built along the Gold Coast, and the coasts of Hueda and Allada in the second half of the 17th century.\n At the same time, there was competition among Europeans, who often struggled with one another for the best access to African trade. It is worth noting that although there was fierce competition between different European nations to trade, this never led to direct military confrontations between them in Africa in this period. Wars fought by European nations were fought in Europe itself, where in Africa European traders were competing as part of a shared cooperative agenda and structure of trade. By the second half of the 17th century, Danish, Dutch, English, French and German trading companies were all seeking to establish a foothold in West Africa, bringing the best and most fashionable trading commodities and negotiating with one another to exchange what they had to make up the best \u201cassortment\u201d.\n The competition among European traders meant that African rulers could often strike better bargains. They could play off one against another to get the best price. But it also meant that they had to meet the demands of traders if these were not to move on elsewhere in search of captives, ivory and gold. Mutual dependence of African rulers and European traders grew; and the increasingly fragile environment, in Africa as elsewhere in the world, created frequent problems of food and resources which could often lead to conflict.

            "response": "The early part of the 17th century brought many changes, which were significant in West Africa and also linked to global shifts involving wars and revolutions across various regions including China, Europe, and Africa.\n\nThese transformations had two main causes:\n1. Environmental pressures due to the \"mini ice age\" that peaked around the 1640s.\n2. Political competition spurred by the rise of a capitalist world system.\n\nRegarding environmental pressures:\nThis period is known as the \"mini ice age,\" starting from about 1570 when there was a notable drop in global temperatures leading to climatic challenges. In Africa, this resulted in droughts in Angola around 1600 and Senegambia around 1640; floods affected Yorub\u00e0-speaking areas of Nigeria and Benin early in the century; Morocco experienced heavy snowfalls. The King of Allada sent ambassadors to Spain during the 1650s partly because he wanted help dealing with severe storms hitting Allada.\n\nGlobally, colder weather worsened agricultural yields affecting wheat among other crops, causing food prices to increase significantly. Some coldest years occurred near 1640 coinciding with major upheavals like civil wars\u2014overthrowing Ming dynasty in China; Portugal's independence from Spain declared same year followed by prolonged conflicts until 1668; England saw its own civil war start in 1641 resulting in regicide and ongoing strife along with internal conflict within France.\n\nWhat led to these temperature drops? European historians often cited solar activity patterns while recent theories from Colombian archaeologists suggest impacts from European conquests over Americas during previous centuries might have caused massive declines (upwards of possibly up to ninety percent) among indigenous populations due primarily diseases or warfare\u2014this reduction could mean more forests grew back on previously cleared lands absorbing more CO2 alongside reduced emissions since fewer fires were set for land clearing purposes aligning with modern understandings related carbon cycles impacting climate change today.\n\nPolitical competition intensified as trade expanded under emerging capitalist influences:\nIn West Africa importance grew regarding establishing trade ties particularly with Europeans where successful states benefited though sometimes at costs such as larger kingdoms seeing coastal provinces gain autonomy (Kajoor broke away by mid-1500s while Nsoyo did so early next century). Rival leaders vied for favorable trading posts escalating both local conflicts but also boosting demand for European goods leading extensive fortified post constructions along Gold Coast plus coasts Hueda & Allada later half-century noted.\n\nMeanwhile Europeans themselves competed fiercely yet without direct military confrontations locally instead their battles remained confined within Europe itself despite aggressive pursuits African trades under cooperative frameworks structures established amongst them Danish Dutch English French German companies all aimed securing footholds negotiating collectively ensuring optimal assortments traded items available marketplaces throughout region second half-century observed closely how African rulers managed leverage positions effectively playing one against another achieving better deals meeting demands traders who otherwise would seek opportunities elsewhere potentially involving captives ivory gold etc mutual dependencies between local rulers foreign merchants increased just fragile environments globally continued posing frequent resource shortages contributing potential conflicts arising periodically overall interconnectedness highlighted through economic ecological political lenses viewed retrospectively understanding broader implications shaping historical narratives discussed herein comprehensively"

Most societies across the globe had fell victim of some sort of subjugation from more powerful societies/class. One can talk of situations like Colonialism, the Jewish Holocaust in the Second World War, the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade (TAST) among others. After the Suppressed have been able to liberate themselves from the shackles of such conditions, there is always a quest for reparation. This form of reparation can be in kind or materialistic. The most known and controversial of them of is the reparation for slavery in Africa; the argument is that some form of compensatory payment needs to be made to the descendants of Africans who had been enslaved as part of the TAST.\n The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade which led to displacement of Africans into the New World had commoditized humans rather than other trading items like gold and ivory among others as goods. Africans were taken by European merchants across the Atlantic Ocean after the discovery of the New World to provide the needed labour power in plantations. This trade had devastated African society at home and in the diaspora as well. African slaves were obtained through warfare, kidnapping and as sale product from the market among other sources. These slaves suffered severe conditions through the Middle passage, on the plantation system and psychological trauma after emancipation. It is based on these injustice against slaves and their descendants in the Americas that African-Americans and members of the Caribbean diaspora are increasingly questing for reparation. ",

These compensations can be in various forms, either as goods or money. One well-known and debated example is reparations for slavery in Africa; there's an argument that descendants of enslaved Africans should receive some form of compensation due to the TAST.\n\nThe Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade resulted in many Africans being forcibly moved to the New World where they were treated as commodities rather than human beings like gold or ivory. European traders transported them across the Atlantic Ocean after discovering new lands to work on plantations requiring labor power. This trade severely impacted African communities both at home and abroad.\n\nAfrican slaves were captured through warfare, kidnapping, or bought from markets among other means. They endured extreme hardships during their transport via ships known as 'the Middle Passage,' suffered on plantations, and faced psychological trauma even after emancipation.\n\nIt is because of these injustices against slaves and their descendants now living in America and parts of the Caribbean that there are growing calls for reparation."

The anti-slavery issue and the humanitarian conscience also played a vital role in stimulating European interest in Africa and gave an impetus to mission work. It included the opening up of Africa to forces of change namely commerce (\u201clegitimate commerce\u201d, i.e. non-slave trade), Christianity, Civilization and Colonization. The others included the Christian responsibility for the regeneration of African peoples.\n The achievement of the purpose of these Christian Missions came with some costs. Several missionaries died at a youthful age due to the unfriendly tropical climate. Again, in West-Africa, the efforts to go beyond the coast to reach those inland with the gospel coincided with the southwards expansion of Islam which posed some threat to the expansion of the work of Christian evangelizing missions. The work of the missionaries also had little success initially. The people received the message with indifference. It was however in the coastal territories filled with mulattos and other European trading communities that Christianity won some of its early success.\n The first Europeans arrived at the West-African Coasts at the end of the fifteenth century. For several years they paid attention to slave trade rather than evangelization and Christianization of the people of West-Africa. However, by the turn of the Nineteenth Century there was systematic efforts by churches of Christian Europe, namely: Anglicans, Methodists, and Baptists who were active in Sierra Leone and, with Presbyterians, in Nigeria, while Methodists also set up missions in Ghana, Gambia, and Dahomey. In the 19thh century, too, Afro-Brazilians returned to Benin and Nigeria with Catholicism.\n A new era began with the settlements of Black Christians from Nova Scotia in Sierra Leone in 1787 and the missionary advance inland from Cape Town beginning with the arrival there of J. T. van der Kemp in 1799. New missionary societies (the LMS, the CMS, the Holy Ghost Fathers, the White Fathers, etc.) began work in many parts of Africa.\n The CMS began to work in the freed slave villages in Sierra Leone in 1804 and the Methodist in 1811. The early success of the missionaries included areas like Freetown and surrounding villages. Some early success included the Liberian coast where Afro-Americans and freed slaves were converted. The others include the French trading posts at Grand Bassam (Ivory Coast), Assinie and Libreville in Gabon.\n Apart from the extreme south and the Horn, the interior was hardly touched by Europeans before the last quarter of the Nineteenth Century. At the end of the eighteenth century, the Evangelical Revival began to bring to Africa an influx of missionaries whose laoburs would produce the first fruits of an enduring Christian presence in Sub-Sahara Africa.\n In the later 19th century, the immense African interior remained the principal object of the Catholic Priests, and from 1867 until his death in November 1892 Cardinal Lavigerie planned the planting of churches in Africa South of the Sahara. It is important to emphasize that the modern history of the Christian Mission in Africa started from the late Eighteenth Century, the Catholics had been there earlier in the first centuries of the Christian era especially during the first Portuguese adventures. Therefore the period for the rise of Christianizing Missions in the late Nineteenth Century has been considered as reprise. The late Eighteenth Century witnessed the rise of Christian groups in Europe that resorted to the evangelization of Africa. For instance, on 2nd October 1792, the Baptist Missionary Society was formed followed by the interdenominational London Missionary Society which was established in 1795. The others include the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1804, which was tasked with the responsibility of promoting the translation and printing of the Holy Bible. Initially, a majority of the missionary journeys was done with English-Speaking Protestants and later, in the 1820s and 1830s, they were joined by continental Protestantism from Germany, Switzerland and France. There were related organizations that sprang up in Scandinavia, Holland and the USA.\n West Africa owes to the Christian missionaries not only a new religious faith which has changed the beliefs and life of millions of people, but also the foundation of western education. The Portuguese were the first to introduce the Christian faith into West Africa but following their departure from the West Coast in the mid-seventeenth century, the Christian religion survived only in Upper Guinea where a bishop was maintained in the Cape Verde Islands serving also a part of the mainland. It was not until the nineteenth century, that the new religion was really established in West Africa.\n In this chapter, we shall examine how Christianity and Western-style education influenced West Africans values, attitudes and life-styles.

Issues like anti-slavery and humanitarian concerns also boosted European interest in Africa, encouraging mission work. This included opening up Africa to new influences such as trade (specifically non-slave trade), Christianity, civilization, and colonization.\n\nCarrying out these missions came with challenges. Many missionaries died young due to the harsh tropical climate. In West Africa, spreading the gospel inland coincided with Islam expanding southwards, which threatened Christian efforts. Initially, local people were indifferent to the missionaries' message. However, early successes were seen along coastal areas populated by mixed-race communities and European traders.\n\nEuropean contact with West Africa began in the late fifteenth century but initially focused more on slave trading than on evangelization or Christianization of locals. By the nineteenth century though, systematic efforts from various Christian denominations like Anglicans, Methodists, Baptists (active in Sierra Leone), Presbyterians (in Nigeria), and Methodists again (in Ghana) started making an impact.\n\nA significant change occurred when Black Christians from Nova Scotia settled in Sierra Leone in 1787 followed by further missionary advances inland from Cape Town starting in 1799 by J.T van der Kemp among others forming new missionary societies across many parts of Africa.\n\nMissionary success stories include places like Freetown where early conversions happened around freed slave villages since CMS's involvement beginning 1804 followed by Methodist missions established there by 1811.\n\nDespite this progress throughout most regions except for extreme southern parts and Horn of Africa remained largely untouched until later centuries when Evangelical Revival brought more missionaries leading towards a lasting Christian presence across Sub-Saharan Africa during late eighteenth century onwards.\n\nIn terms of Catholic endeavors during later nineteenth-century immense focus was placed on interior regions led notably under Cardinal Lavigerie\u2019s plans till his death in November 1892 aiming at establishing churches South of Sahara emphasizing how modern history regarding Christian Missions within continent initiated significantly post-late Eighteenth Century despite earlier Catholic presences dating back first Portuguese explorations thus marking period as revival phase concerning rise of evangelical groups targeting African evangelization highlighted through formation events such as Baptist Missionary Society on October 2nd ,1792 alongside London Missionary Society founded three years later including other related organizations promoting religious texts translations via British Foreign Bible Society established back then too gradually joined over decades following initial English-speaking Protestant majority participation eventually expanded involving continental Protestants from Germany Switzerland France plus additional support coming Scandinavia Holland USA respectively .\n\nWest Africans not only gained a new religion through these missionary activities but also foundations for Western education originally introduced by Portuguese who after leaving mid-seventeenth century saw continued survival mainly Upper Guinea maintaining bishopric within Cape Verde Islands serving mainland portions yet it wasn\u2019t until nineteenth-century substantial establishment took place region-wide examining impacts Christianity alongside Western-style educational influences shaping local values attitudes lifestyles overall."

But despite the work of Portuguese missionaries based on the island of Sao Tome and later of Spanish missionaries in Benin, it was not until the nineteenth century that the Christian religion was firmly established in Nigeria. It started first among the Yoruba recaptives who had embraced the Christian faith while in Sierra Leone (freed from slave trading ships by the British Royal Naval Squadron), and who returned home between 1839 and 1845. The pastors of the Church Missionary Society, from Badagry and later from Sierra Leone, visited these Christian communities in Abeokuta and other towns. Among the first missionaries was the Rev. Henry Townsend who went from Sierra Leone to Badagry in 1842 in his company was the Rev Ajayi Crowther.\nSuccess followed the efforts of the pioneer missionaries. C.M.S. churches were firmly established in several important towns, such as Abeokuta (1846), Lagos (1851), Ibadan (1853), and Oyo (1856). Next, branches of the C.M.S. church were founded in south-eastern Nigeria, the chief centres being Bonny and Brass. The effects of work done by Bishop Ajayi Crowther, assisted by the Igbo recaptive the Rev. J. C. Taylor, in these parts of southern Nigeria can still be seen today.\n Other missionaries opened mission stations in the country. These included the Baptist missionaries who under the American evangelist, Thomas Bowen, started work from Ogbomosho in 1855.

Hugh Goldie and William Anderson.

Operating from Whydah in what is today the People\u2019s Republic of Benin (formerly Dahomey), Father Berghero, in 1860, visited Abeokuta and Lagos where freed Catholic slaves from Brazil welcomed him warmly. A permanent station was established in Lagos in 1868, soon followed by others at Lokoja, Abeokuta and Ibadan. Within ten years of Father Berghero\u2019s visit, the Roman Catholic Church in Nigeria had become so well established that it ceased to be under administration from Dahomey. By 1885, the church had spread further inland, thanks to Father Joseph Lutz who started work around Onitsha in 1886 and spread the gospel in many parts of the present day Imo and Anambra States. Another important Catholic missionary in this area was the Irishman, Bishop Shanahan. Although Lokoja had a small C.M.S. station in 1858, it was not until 1889 that the missionaries entered Hausaland, which was predominantly Muslim. Their converts, for many years, were confined to the people of southern Nigerian extraction resident in the north, and to the-large non-Muslim population of the north. ",

It is estimated that the spread of Plague between 1346 and 1353 led to the deaths of between 30 and 50% of the European population. Some archaeologists also believe that this Plague had an impact in West African populations [the evidence for this remains challenged, but it is an interesting hypothesis; the archaeologist G\u00e9rard Chouin has been the strongest proponent of this idea]. \n With the population collapse, European nations such as Portugal faced many problems. Their workforce had more than halved, which meant that much farming land was taken over by forests and plants. Interestingly, one of the first sources available on the West African presence in Portugal, from the Portuguese Cortes or parliament at \u00c9vora in 1471, says that African labourers were vital for clearing wastelands in the country: this suggests a strong labour shortage in Europe after the Plague, and the role of African labour in addressing this. Many of the nobles had lost their labourers [known as serfs], and civil wars resulted in Portugal in the 1380s. There was both a shortage of wheat to make bread, and very high inflation of the Portuguese currency [known as the escudo]. Both of these factors prompted the Portuguese interest in Morocco, since, 1, Morocco was a fertile country and a grower of wheat; and 2, the Portuguese hoped that through sailing along the coast of West Africa, they might find access to West African gold supplies and protect their currency. \n By contrast to the situation in Europe, many states in West Africa in the 15th century were in a process of expansion and growth. Mossi was established in the 15th century in Burkina Faso, Kano became a major power, and Songhay rose to usurp the power of the Mali Empire. Much of this growth came with increased gold production in the Akan states of Ghana. So much gold was produced that the trans-Saharan trade did not bring enough goods to exchange at Kano, and many gold traders left empty-handed [this is according to the early 16th-century Muslim traveller from southern Spain known generally as Leo Africanus].\n The Portuguese were aware of this growth through a number of channels. The Catalan Atlas of c.1375 was a map drawn by a Majorcan Jew called Abraham Cresques, which showed the power of Mali and its gold production in detail.\n The Atlas showed good trade connections between Spain and West Africa via the Sahara, often undertaken by Jewish traders. These traders spread news about West Africa in Spain and Portugal. There were Jewish communities in Saharan settlements such as Tuat, and after riots against Spanish Jews in 1391 more settled in Morocco and worked in the carpet and textile trade to and from the Mali Empire. \n Knowing something of the conditions in Africa, therefore, Portuguese leaders were keen to make connections with West African gold producers [Portugal also had a large Jewish population]. They also hoped to meet with a Christian King who they called Prester John, and who they believed lived somewhere in Africa. They wanted a Christian alliance against the Islamic Ottoman Empire, which was growing in power; and to divert some of the gold supply. Prester John probably referred to the Christian King of Ethiopia, but this was not known at the time. \n All of these factors shaped the Portuguese voyages to West Africa, and their arrival at the Senegal river in 1442.",

Some experts think this Plague also affected West African populations, though evidence is debated; archaeologist G\u00e9rard Chouin strongly supports this theory.\n\nThe massive loss of people caused many issues for European countries like Portugal. Their workforce was greatly reduced, leading to farmland being overrun by forests and plants. Records from the Portuguese parliament at \u00c9vora in 1471 indicate that African workers were crucial for clearing these lands, highlighting a significant labor shortage in Europe post-Plague and the important role of African laborers.\n\nMany nobles lost their workers, known as serfs, which led to civil wars in Portugal during the 1380s. There was a lack of wheat for bread and high inflation of the Portuguese currency called escudo. These problems drove Portuguese interest towards Morocco because it was fertile with wheat production and they hoped sailing along West Africa\u2019s coast might lead them to gold resources to stabilize their currency.\n\nIn contrast, several states in West Africa were expanding during the 15th century. Mossi was established around this time in Burkina Faso; Kano became a major power; Songhay took over from Mali Empire\u2019s dominance\u2014all benefiting from increased gold production especially within Ghana's Akan states where so much gold resulted that traders often left without enough goods to trade back at places like Kano according to Leo Africanus\u2014a Muslim traveler from southern Spain writing early in the next century.\n\nPortuguese knowledge about this growth came through various sources including Abraham Cresques\u2019 Catalan Atlas around c.1375 showing Mali\u2019s wealth and its connections via Sahara trade routes often used by Jewish traders who relayed information back into Spain and Portugal\u2014Jewish communities existed across Saharan areas such as Tuat with more settling after riots against Spanish Jews around 1391 moving into Moroccan regions engaging mainly with carpet/textile trades linked with Mali Empire.\n\nAwareness of conditions within Africa spurred Portuguese leaders' interests not only toward connecting with local gold producers but also seeking an alliance through mythical Christian King Prester John against growing Islamic Ottoman threats aiming partly at diverting some gold supplies\u2014Prester John likely referred mistakenly then as Ethiopia\u2019s Christian King unknown at those times.\n \nThese factors influenced Portuguese explorations leading them eventually reaching Senegal River by year1442."
