            "prompt": "Which are the criteria for making a text dyslexia friendly?",
            "response": "Creating dyslexia-friendly texts involves considering several factors that can make reading easier for individuals with dyslexia. Dyslexia is a learning disorder characterized by difficulties in reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words. Here are some key criteria and guidelines often recommended to enhance readability for those with dyslexia:\n\n1. **Font Choice**: Use fonts that are clear and easy to read. Fonts like Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, Helvetica, Trebuchet MS, OpenDyslexic (designed specifically for people with dyslexia), or Comic Sans are often recommended because of their simple and distinct letter shapes.\n\n2. **Font Size and Spacing**:\n   - Increase font size; typically 12-14 point is good but this might vary based on the specific font.\n   - Use increased line spacing (1.5 to 2 times the normal).\n   - Ensure adequate spacing between characters (not too tight).\n\n3. **Text Layout**:\n   - Align text left; avoid justified text as it creates uneven spaces between words which can be confusing.\n   - Keep paragraphs short.\n   - Utilize bullet points or numbered lists where appropriate.\n\n4. **Color Contrast**:\n    - High contrast between text color and background color aids readability; black text on a white background or vice versa is typical but other high-contrast combinations can also work well.\n    - Avoid backgrounds that are patterned or textured as they may reduce legibility.\n\n5. **Paper Quality**: \n    If printing materials,\n    use matte paper instead of glossy as it reduces glare which can impede reading ability.\n\n6. **Simplification of Content**:\n    Simplify language without patronizing the reader: use straightforward sentences and avoid complex vocabulary unless necessary.\n    \n7 .**Avoid Blocks of Text**: Break up large blocks of information into smaller chunks using headings, subheadings, images etc., making content more manageable.\n\n8 .**Use Images & Diagrams**: Supporting texts with relevant images diagrams helps understanding especially when explaining complex information concepts .\n\n9 .**Consistency**: Maintain consistent layout formatting throughout documents including headers footers margins etc., so readers know what expect each page section .\n\n10 .***Interactive Elements***: For digital texts consider interactive elements such glossaries pop-up definitions hyperlinks additional resources help clarify terms concepts further .\n\n11 ***Testing Feedback*** : It's beneficial test your material real users who have dyslexia get feedback about its effectiveness ease-of-use adjustments needed based their experiences insights .\n   \nBy incorporating these practices you create an environment conducive effective communication comprehension among readers diverse needs abilities particularly those affected by dyslexia ensuring inclusivity accessibility all audiences"

            "prompt": "Which are the principles in Dyslexia Style guide that suggests changes in written material for dyslexic readers?",
            "response": "The Dyslexia Style Guide is designed to provide best practices for creating written material that accommodates dyslexic readers. This guide emphasizes several key principles aimed at improving readability and comprehension for individuals with dyslexia. Here are some of the main recommendations typically found in such guides:\n\n1. **Font and Typography**: Use fonts that are clear and evenly spaced, such as Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, Century Gothic, or similar sans-serif types. Avoid using italicized or underlined text which can blur together.\n\n2. **Font Size**: Text should be set in a larger font size (typically 12-14 point) to enhance readability.\n\n3. **Line Spacing**: Increase line spacing to around 1.5 lines to help distinguish individual lines of text more easily.\n\n4. **Text Alignment**: Left-aligned text is generally easier for dyslexic readers because it provides a consistent starting point on each line; avoid justified text as it creates uneven spaces between words.\n\n5. **Color Contrast**: High contrast between background and text color aids visibility but avoid white backgrounds as they can be too glaring; soft cream or pastel colors work well.\n\n6. **Short Paragraphs**: Break up content into shorter paragraphs to reduce visual stress and aid comprehension by chunking information into manageable parts.\n\n7. **Bullet Points and Numbering**: Use bullet points or numbers for lists instead of large blocks of prose to break down information clearly and sequentially.\n\n8 .**Use Images & Diagrams:** Accompany texts with images, diagrams, charts etc., where appropriate \u2013 these visual aids support understanding by providing alternative ways to access information besides textual reading alone.\n   \n9 .**Avoid Blocks of Capital Letters:** Text written in all caps can be much harder for people with dyslexia to read because letters appear more uniform and thus harder to differentiate.\n    \n10 .**Highlight Important Information:** Bold important terms rather than underlining them - this makes them stand out without causing confusion like underlines might do due their effect on letter shape recognition.\n    \n11 .**Consistent Layouts:** Keep layouts simple consistent across documents so that familiar patterns help orientate the reader quickly every time they approach new material from you.\n   \nThese guidelines aim not only at helping those who struggle with traditional formats but also improve overall accessibility making your communications more inclusive overall!"

Left-aligned text is generally best as it provides a consistent starting point for each line.\n\n4. **Contrast**: High contrast between text color and background color aids readability significantly but avoid harsh contrasts or bright colors which might be glaring; dark grey text on an off-white background is often recommended over pure black on white.\n\n5. **Consistent Layout**: Keep your layout simple and consistent throughout the document or webpage to help orient readers easily.\n\n6. **Short Paragraphs & Sentences**:\n   - Break up long blocks of texts into shorter paragraphs.\n   - Use bullet points where possible.\n   - Write sentences in clear language avoiding complex vocabulary unless necessary.\n\n7. **Use Images & Diagrams**: Supporting texts with images, diagrams or charts can provide context clues about the written content making comprehension easier.\n\n8 .**Avoid Italics/Underlining/Boldface Overuse**: These formatting options can sometimes make print appear denser and harder to read so use them sparingly only for emphasis.\n\n9 .**Readable Line Lengths:** Aim for lines no longer than 60-70 characters including spaces since longer lines may require excessive eye movement causing strain or loss of place while reading\n\n10 .**Highlight Important Information:** Using different colors (subtly) or bold typefaces helps important information stand out without overwhelming readers who struggle with visual stress issues associated with dyslexia\n\n11 .**Provide Summaries or Outlines:** Offering summaries at the beginning of documents gives an overview which prepares readers mentally before diving into detailed sections \n\n12 .**Testing Your Text:**\n    After implementing these changes test your material by getting feedback from actual users especially those known to have Dyslexia This will give you practical insights into how well your adjustments work \n\nBy incorporating these strategies when creating documents websites educational materials etc., you'll not only assist those affected by Dyslexia but also improve overall accessibility making your content user-friendly across broader audiences"
